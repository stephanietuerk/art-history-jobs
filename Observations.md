# Data Observations

### Fed 4, 2023

Wow! There are so many jobs this year -- 146! Art history is BACK!

No but seriously, it may look like it is back numbers wise, but the field is simply not the same in terms of what schools are looking for and also which schools are even looking as it was at the start of this data.

So, what has changed? This is obvious, but if your work doesn't relate to any culture that is non-European, your odds of finding a position are incredibly low.

The 2021-2022 job market saw a huge increase in the number of positions in African / African Disapora art. No to be crass, but this makes sense. This was the first year for job searches after the murder of George Floyd, and clearly art history departments recognized the need to make amends for the fact that Black artists and makers and had historically been excluded from art history teaching.

So I was a bit surprised when the 2022-2023 data came in and showed that this category of jobs had expanded even further this year. Honestly when I was reading through the job descriptions I had the mentality that I do when I looked at tech job descriptions in 2022 -- like, "uh, you do know that it's a buyer's market right now what are you doing to make yourself standout from all the other schools who want to hire someone for this field." Which was wild -- I would never had imagined that looking at art history jobs could feel that way, even this many years after I have been out of the field.

Another category that really seems to have exploded, unsurprisingly, are jobs looking for someone who works on art of indigenous peoples, particularly in North America, the latter of which get classified as `North American Art`.

It felt to me like jobs that are specifically for only a Latin Americanist, or someone who works on Islamic art history are not as prevalent as they were a few years ago, and now many more jobs are just like, "just please work on anything but white people." In reality they say "expertise in fields including but not limited to Asian, African, Central/South American, Indigenous North American, and/or Oceanic art and architecture." For the record, I generally through a job like that into the `Global / Non-Western Art` category. It's funny -- "non-Western" feels like a very dated term to me, and I get it, it centers Europe whereas saying "Asian, African, Central/South American, Indigenous North American, and/or Oceanic" recognizes all of those cultures. But it sure does take fewer characters!

Another thing I saw in the data this year were a number of searches for Chair positions, often that had minimal or no teaching expectations. I had to make a new `rank` category for them, as they felt substantively different.

Finally, one more thing that surprised me was the variety of schools that were looking to hire an art historian. While there were _so many_ jobs this year, it felt like, at most, the usual number of jobs at the high-resource schools that have traditionally had the most developed art history programs. (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc.) What seemed to have proliferated were job listings at much lower-resource schools -- there were a number of listings at community colleges and commuter schools. In many ways I think this is great -- I was definitely under the impression that art history was certainly not an expanding field and I'm happy to learn that schools think it has value. It also seems great to have the opportunity to introduce art history to students who come from a much wider variety of backgrounds. A few schools note the particular characteristics of their student bodies and request that the candidate be able to tailor curricula to that population, i.e. make it relevant to them, which again, is great. On the other hand, I think it's safe to assume that fewer resources at a school translates into low pay, which is just depressing.

This all does make me realize that I likely should try to aggregate the list of schools for each year. (Unfortunately it would have to be done manually, boo.)
