First Round Interview: invited to interview at CAA (1/23 X2)
Rejection:
Campus Interview: invited by phone (2/25) (x2) Really? on Saturday?! COuld I ask your area of specialization, please.
I have it on good faith that it is an inside candidate.

What makes you say that? There doesn't appear to be anyone listed in the catalog as teaching Asian art this year (http://www.bowdoin.edu/art-history/courses/index.shtml).
I have it on good faith that there is an inside candidate (recommended to the search). May I ask your field of specialization. What is there to lose now? My field is Silk Road archaeology.
inside candidate doesn't necessarily mean anything - i was recommended to the search committee, invited enthusiastically to apply but then not even interviewed......
The inside candidate is a Bowdoin grad.
Just stop it already with the inside candidate business. Let the people who have been invited for campus visits prepare in peace, without having to be psyched out with misinformation and/or third-hand gossip. The whole process is stressful enough. (By the way, I am not one of the final candidates.)
I hope the inside candidate information is not true - the committee seemed so nice and genuine. Fooled again? :-(
There was and is no 'inside candidate' among the finalists for this search. And for those who are concerned, as someone who has been a true 'inside candidate' - i.e., in a term position applying for a tenure track version of the same job at the same institution - rest assured that it is a decidedly double-edged sword.
We all understand the double-edged sword part, but did you get that job?
Yes, and I declined it. Double-edge sword in many ways.



-) edge none the less - offers are often made to inside candidates who do have an edge.
The point is that the inside candidate is just as often at a serious disadvantage. As with so many things in the job market, there is really no way to tell what the situation is from the outside, so the mere presence of an inside candidate should not be taken by outside candidates as indicative of anything. If the ultimate question that people worry about is whether an inside candidate means that there is less chance of someone outside ending up with the job, take the small sample set of this year's Asian market as exemplary: there were at least three TT searches with ""inside candidates"" this year in Asian, Middlebury, McGill and Macalester (maybe others, too). AFAIK, in two of the three, the insider will NOT end up with the job and the third remains undecided. Given all the vagueries of the job market and based on this small sample, inside candidates should not be anyone's big concern. This is *especially* the case for one whose insider's status derives from having gotten their BA at the searching institution, which was the (false) rumor circulating around Bowdoin.

Offer: 3/18 Offer made [definitely not an inside candidate, it appears to be a S. Asian modernis (3/27 offer declined; new offer out)
? A new offer to the second choice person or new better offer to first choice ????
3/31 I dont know if a new offer is out to another candidate (perhaps the earlier poster knows?) but I did decline the offer earlier this week because of personal/family reasons. Best of luck to the other two candidates! Bowdoin is a genuinely good school and the person who joins will, I think, enjoy the academic ethos there. [All the best. And hope this means you have a better offer. May I ask what your area of specialization?] S Asia [Islamic, Buddhist, Colonial, other? Interesting that they chose S Asia. Some China specialists thought they would hire East Asian again. Thanks for sharing]
4/10 I am not the person who declined this offer, but I am told (by a current Bowdoin student) it was someone who specializes in Islamic art. No idea about the 2nd choice candidate.
4/14 False- the original offer went to a specialist of 19th and 20th century India. No news on where things stand now.
An offer has been made and accepted (not by me, though I was the third finalist). (4/16) can i ask your field? and that of the second finalist if known?

I am a China specialist. I won't say what the finalist/successful candidate's field is as it's not my information to share and it will be public knowledge soon enough. (4/19)

These were both listed as ASIAN positions- not ISLAMIC!

That is striking, since we all know there isn't any Islamic art to be found in Asia.
Right on. Moreover, this sort of thing happens all the time and we should not be ALL CAPS outraged when it does: search committees will go for the best candidates, even if this means going slightly outside of the job ad's target area; the Courtauld is lucky to have Sussan (x3). Good luck to everybody else. May the job fairy smile upon you.
Agreed! Sussan is a first rate scholar and a wonderful choice. I have learned a lot from her work, and I am not an Islamicist. As for regions, the U.S. may call it ' middle east' but several billion people elsewhere in the world call the same region 'west asia'. Sussan's work often spans the region even we in the U.S. call 'central asia'. (x2)

Total of 3 scheduled by end of March. (3/13) -1: withdrew to accept another position (4/2)
Offer: Made (Apr 3- when I learned about it, don't know when/who it was extended to or how long pending)

It must have been extended on the 3rd, because when I withdrew the evening of the 2nd, their ordered list of candidates was under review with the dean, but they had not yet made an offer.
Is this position different than the one for Assist. Prof. that is being reviewed starting 4/16? http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwart/6242.html Looks like they are hedging their bets that at least one of the lines (Assistant Prof. or Lecturer) will be funded (4/16)
As one of the 3 finalists (I posted above when I withdrew), I know that at least 2 of the 3 accepted positions elsewhere. My guess, therefore, is that this search failed and that they have reopened it under the Asst. Prof. ad that the previous poster provided a link to. Unless the 3rd person posts here that they accepted the original position, I would proceed on that assumption. Based on course offerings in recent years, my guess is that the lecturer position is completely separate and is to replace someone who has been teaching non-Western as a lecturer in recent years. That ad predates the supposed failure of the tenure-track Asianist search, which would lead me to believe that both the tenure-track and the lecturer positions are funded (the lecturer a replacement of an existing lecturer line, the asst. prof. a new tenure-track line that was originally searched for last fall) and that they hope to fill both. Again, of all this is just (well-)educated guesswork from a former finalist, so take it for what it's worth. (4/16)

Offer: 3/19 Offer Made and accepted
3/29: To the above poster: I just want to clarify that an informal/verbal offer has been extended and a formal offer has not been made yet - hence ""Offer Made and accepted"" is not exactly accurate. May I suggest that when updating on wiki we clarify when the information is hearsay? That would ensure clarity and avoid confusion.
4/11: For future readers of this hoping to gain an idea of the past timeframes of these searches, this job was indeed offered and accepted as indicated despite the uninformed protests above.
4/14: does anyone know the name and specialization of the selected candidate?
4/14: Offer accepted by Sugata Ray (Ph.D. University of Minnesota-Twin Cities)
4/25: At least two South Asianist (including I) did not apply for this post because we thought the position was for a Buddhist specialist. The advertisement clearly said ""Participation in Berkeley's Buddhist Studies Ph.D. Program is expected"". The offer has been accepted by someone who works on 19th/20th century Hindu temples. One does not argue that it is up to the committee whom they choose in the end, but the advertisement was clearly misleading. Moral of the story - apply for everything.
4/25: I don't think the ad was intentionally misleading. You have to recognize the multiple voices, interests, and politics that underlie the wording of these postings. The Berkeley Art History department has indeed had a long-standing and productive partnership with the Buddhist Studies Program; no doubt, they (or at least some) hope to sustain that, and I wouldn't be surprised if the chosen candidate will be expected (by some) to participate in the program. Point is: assume politics and multiple interests--and yes, apply for everything.

First Round Interview:
They moved *very* quickly on their modern/contemporary search - any word on interviews for this position? (4/18)
Rejection:
Campus Interview: Interviews began April 19.
-- thanks for the info. That's a very efficient search committee....
-- for an alternative view of this process, see the comments on their modern/contemporary search, above
-- predetermined
-- yes, that's certainly how it seems.
Note: this is a copy of the comment on the 20thC search. !. My last comment was deleted. This ""search"" has been executed in an extremely unprofessional and possibly unethical manner. Here are some key facts based on insider accounts and documented facts. Both positions were not widely advertised. They were not listed on CAA, Chronicle of Higher Ed, or Akimbo for example. They were only listed on UAAC and the University's website. Prior to the jobs even being posted officially, faculty reached out to candidates they were interested in. One candidate currently being interviewed was told about the possible job opening as early as last December. Allegedly, faculty looked at applicants files before the deadline. The deadline was April 8, The faculty met for the first time to review all the applications for both job searches on April 12, 4 days after the deadline. On the same day interviews were scheduled. Given that such tenure-track jobs are getting 100+ applicants these days, it is unbelievable that all applications were considered, even provisionally, before interviews were arranged.The first interview was on April 19. Very few people are attendig the candidates' talks, and they are not being announced publicly to the university community. Allegedly one of the people being interviewed is a good friend of one of the faculty members. I am appalled at the arrogance of this search and the waste of time it has meant for so many people involved, including the hundreds of reference letters that were solicited in the context of what was most certainly a pre-deternimed ""search"". I personally expect higher standards. Your comments are welcome as I hope this engenders some discussion.
-- Eloquently expressed. Anyone who has ever sent an application in good faith and in a belief in process and equity has been had.
-- where is the accountability?
- Yes, that appears to be an important question. Where is the accountability? If as was mentioned above one of the candidates is a close fried of the faculty meember is this faculty on the hiring committee? Does this not represent conflict of interests?
- Any comments that aren't simply copied from the Modern/Contemporary search above?
- As someone who's been on both sides of the table, I can only say that searches are more complex beasts than applicants generally realize. I had never even heard of this particular university until reading the Wiki so I have no idea what's going on here, but there's any number of reasons why this job wouldn't have been advertised earlier or more widely. Sometimes, for example, administrations drag their feet in approving searches, and departments don't get the official go-ahead until spring. Who knows what happened in this case. I can say that is not unethical or unheard-of for departments to undertake advance outreach to candidates who happen to be on their radar (whether through personal or professional connections). In many cases, committees will solicit names from friends/colleagues in other departments well in advance of the larger deadline, and invite recommended people to apply personally. This is standard operating procedure -- but it doesn't necessarily mean that those people are shoo-ins for the post. If, as you indicate, this position was not widely advertised, and if indeed it had such a short turnaround between initial posting and deadline, the chances are good that the committee was faced with far fewer than 100 applications to read. And if they did have a significant number, there is nothing wrong with starting to review them before the deadline. (Obviously the committee should not dismiss anyone before reading their full application packet, including supporting materials. But if everything's in place, readers can at least start getting a sense of what the pool looks like before the final burst of materials arrives on the last day.) As far as campus visits go, I know there are some departments that advertise job talks to all and sundry, but that's not the norm. Most departments (at least in my experience) have enough trouble getting all their own faculty and grad students to show up, let alone those of other departments. Specific people in other depts. who have some particular interest in the search might be notified of talks, but the ""university community"" is often not aware of them. Finally, as much as most departments work hard to find the objectively right person, sometimes it's impossible to avoid apparent conflicts of interest when it comes to candidates being friendly with faculty members. Keep in mind that part of what committees are ultimately looking for is not just the most brilliant scholar but also the one who meshes the best with the departmental community. It sucks when you've applied someplace ""blind"" only to learn that there are other applicants with inside connections, but this is part of the reality of being in a relatively small field. Keep in mind, too, that there is *no guarantee* that the person who's chummy with a faculty member is going to meet with the approval of the rest of the department. (In fact, in departments that are not harmonious that kind of connection could prove a liability instead of an asset.) All this points to two conclusions, neither of which entails giving up your conviction that the system does (usually) work and that qualified people do get jobs: 1) do good work, get a publication in a peer-reviewed journal, and write a kickass application that will make you stand out even if you are not personally known to the committee, and 2) make yourself visible in the larger field -- at CAA, specialized conferences, and/or, again, peer-reviewed journals -- so that, in the next round, *you* will be the person who gets invited to apply to that plum job.
-- Here, here. Thank you to the above poster. To repeat what I just wrote for the modern/contemp search at Guelph: I have been on half a dozen search committees and I can concur with above comment that nothing is out of order in the practices described. (I have no conneciton to this particular search and in fact have never even heard of Guelph.) The problem instead is the anxiety that many Wiki posters/readers are feeling about the job search process, no doubt fed by a lack of information about what really goes on. My recommendation is to have a sit-down with your advisor and ask questions about the process. My department does this collectively every year - in fact, I'm one of the organizers of such job-related discussions for our grad students. Once you understand the process better, the things going on at Guelph will seem less strange. And just maybe it will also appease -- even just a little -- the anxiety. Good luck. (PS. If you think that all job searches are getting 100+ applicants, you are truly, truly feeling the pressure of this anxiety-ridden Wiki universe. I'm beginning to believe that this Wiki site does more harm than good.)

Hear hear. I'm surprised, actually, that the institution doesn't have standards and rules to avoid this kind of flawed search process.
It seems that neither the university nor the department are required to be accountable. They get away with it because they clearly can.
--What's wrong with you? They don't have to list this position anywhere they don't want. It's fine to advise people that an opening is coming up ahead of time--it's actually best practices in hiring. So on the one hand you complain there weren't enough ads, and on the other you complain that they tried too hard to get the word out. The department only has to follow Canadian labor law, and I suspect they did. And there is absolutely nothing wrong, legally or ethically, with reviewing files before a deadline. You need to calm down and re-direct your energy more productively. I guess this is what comes of a ridiculously tight labor market along with pseudo-understanding of employment/affirmative action policies.
--The process described does not sound fishy to me in the least. in fact, it seems like they are really efficient and clear on their objectives. If only all searches went so quickly.
-- There may be nothing wrong with reviewing files before a deadline, but if a department has a specific individual in mind and runs a pseudo-search with a predetermined outcome (hiring candidate X), there is something wrong with this, being, at the very least, a waste of everyone else's time. I'm not saying that this *is* what happened here, but something about the timing of this search obviously smelled fishy to others on this list.
-- To the person outraged by what s/he perceives as unethical practices: I have been on half a dozen search committees and I can concur with above comments that nothing is out of order in the practices that you describe. (I have no conneciton to this particular search and in fact have never even heard of Guelph.)

Offer: the offer was made; accepted by David Kim (PhD Harvard, 2009)
Congrats David!
I heard that the offer was a double one.
Remarkable passage from the rejection letter (received on 3/26): ""It is gratifying, at least, to see that this field is finally a target of numerous other job searches, and while we now have to compete with some other outstanding programs for our own appointment, it is apparent that you will have other choices yourself if you are still willing to make a move to a new university setting"". - Also noted with astonishment at the lack of tact (3/28). Yes, are we really supposed to feel sorry for them that their finalists might get other offers?
-I fail to see what you people find so offensive in this language. They're just trying to be upbeat. Basically, they're saying ""we hope very much that you're able to find another position,"" just stated in stilted art-historican academese.
- I'm less offended at the message of that passage (insofar as I understand it) than at the horrible, convoluted writing. It sounds as if it were run through Google Translator! So the only reason that you, the rejected candidate, do not have ""other choices"" is that you are unwilling to relocate? WTF? And Early Modern Italy is ""finally"" the target of other job searches?
--My suggestion is don't read the rejection letters too closely. If you don't, you won't get angry over them. It doesn't pay and ends up slowly erroding your self-esteem. Take it from someone who's received a lot of rejection letters. (And yes, that passage was convoluted!)

Campus Interview:
Offer: Has an offer been made? Yes. And accepted.
That last comment is incorrect. No offer has been made so far. Who is writing these comments in the first place? The search is continuing.
(04/5) Search failed. For similar reasons to their pre-classical search last year reportedly.
4/5: What were the reasons last year. More importantly, this year?

Don't know about this year's search or the post above, but last year the aged, unproductive half of the department failed it simply to spite those more theoretically inclined and/or who work in the premodern world.
4/6. This may all be true -- worth noting that the finalists have heard nothing from the search committee or the department chair since campus interviews were conducted in January (!!).
(April 8) Commentary: Princeton is a grim, grim place. A wealthy retirement community for senile academics. However, let us all hope that a junior academic will break in and the above posts are untrue- they have so many resources and no one any longer capable of significant, creative work on their faculty.
-- CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT YOU MEAN BY THE ""ABOVE POSTS"" being ""UNTRUE""? Did the search *not* fail?

It looks like a finalist needs get up the courage and ask.
Tried that, met with silence. (4/13)
Well you are to be commended for that. I think we should perhaps all recall the history of this line: it was vacated and then searched and failed for almost *20* years- the administration was about to pull it from them and they were forced to hire Curcic from U Illinois out of desperation simply not to lose it, but not because he was particularly respected or, as it turns out, productive. Now, will we see history repeating itself?
Sorry, but the tone of this commentary seems unnecessarily hostile. I am not associated with Princeton, but I think there's no need to so thoroughly trash any institution, nor particular scholars. Perhaps some of the vitriol could be held in check. -- Agreed! I am also not linked with Princeton, but dismayed to see so much anger posted here. Curcic in particular is a good colleague who doesn't deserve to be trashed publicly just because of the frustrations of some members of this community.
5/6- So in any case, another failed search apparently?
5/16 - I ask this out of curiosity, because I really don't know: Does anyone here know when the last time was that a junior faculty member in ancient, medieval (Western or Byzantine), or early modern fields received tenure in this department? It seems to me that they *have* had a record of hiring exciting young scholars, but they don't keep them around long enough for them to have an impact on the departmental culture. I suspect some of the vitriol we see here (variations of which I've been hearing for years) comes from their poor record of supporting junior faculty.
5/22 Word of mouth: the search is ongoing.
6/30 The search can no longer be considered ""ongoing."" The appropriate term for a search that was the very first to be posted on CAA in the summer of 2011, and which has yet to result in an offer, much less a hire, after multiple rounds of campus visits, is ""failed."" I believe the answer to the query of 5/16 is ""1983.""
7/3: The correct answer to the 5/16 ? re: tenure: 1989 when Patricia Fortini Brown rec'd tenure/promotion in the early modern field. Also, Thomas Leisten (Islamicist) rec'd tenure in the late 90s. The 11/12 search has officially failed, a new posting has appeared seeking a Byzantine specialist at either the Associate or Full Professor level.

Campus Interview: Invited Nov. 1 for campus interview in early December

DUDE! Check your facts and make sure you are posting on the correct listing! They have NOT yet invited candidates to campus. The committee has not even met after the Skype interviews.
My facts are straight: Skype interview on October 9, further writing samples requested on October 17, invitation from Prof. Julia Andrews for an early-December visit to OSU on November 1. I know they have been doing rolling Skype interviews; perhaps my timeline has simply been different from yours.
I spoke with the administrator who organizes the Skype and campus interviews and she said that the committee has not even met again to discuss campus visits let alone invited anyone (Nov. 13). She is the one who organizes campus visits, so she should know...
From someone with inside information: as of this week, 3 invitations have been extended and campus visits scheduled. It's possible that others may be added in the future.
Four finalists, three completed campus interviews/presentations already, the last takes place Jan 17th. One of the four candidates already teaching in the dept. at OSU. (update 1/15/13)
Email circulated Nov 14 listing 4 finalist candidates campus visits. Administrator giving out erroneous info.

Curious if there's been any movement on these? (Oct. 13) I haven't heard a thing other than the request to fill out the EO data (Oct. 30 x 3)
Position 1: First Round Interview: (none)
Position 1 Rejection:  Check. (honestly, did they send rejection letters out already?) -- I don't know about letters, but finalists for the first position were notified that an offer was made. 
Position 1 Campus Interview:

First round of campus visits is underway. A second round is supposed to take place in the spring.
(11/19) Thank you for posting that- do you know if the present interviews are for the Medieval line or the Byzantine line? or are they interviewing both Med. and Byz. at the same time?
It seems they are looking at tenure-level people first (in both Med. and Byz.). Presumably they will turn their attention to junior people in the spring. [Thank you again for posting this! you've saved me, and I'm sure others, from a dark winter full of needless anxiety and speculation.]
Position 1 Offer:  An offer has been made (Out of curiousity, Western Medieval or Byzantine?). -- Western.
Position 2 First Interview: (My guess is that there won't be a skype/conference interview given their past practices)
Any news on the second position? Yes, any news on anything?
Position 2 Campus Interview:   Invitations to junior candidates have been extended. (Congrats to those invited and break a leg!)
Position 2 Offer: (any final news on this?) x2 [yeah, whatever happened with these- is it really true they both failed?] Failed search for position 1. Position 1 did not fail. -- Search for a tenured scholar failed. The Position 1 hire was made at the Assistant level (though the person is very established and deserves tenure by any reasonable standards). 
Do you know for a fact that the senior search ""failed,"" or just that they are having to recalibrate? 

Recalibrate? It'll take a little more than that. As the saying goes, 'there's no such thing as a failed search, only a failed department.'  
The suggestion that JHU's department has failed is ridiculous on it's face. ""recalibration"" might be a euphemism for ""go to candidate number 2."" Because no one has confirmed that the search has in fact ""failed."" 
It is a tried and true axiom: given the incredible wealth of talent nowadays in any pool, there is no excuse that any open rank search should fail other than departmental dysfunction, even should they initially give offers to senior candidates who use and decline offers simply to get a raise at their present institution. 
Just because the search for position one may have failed (and many signs point to yes), does not mean that the search for position two will fail. However, if both searches fail that seems to send some disturbing signals about the department. 
Does anyone know what's happening re: the search for the junior position, and whether an offer has been extended? 
An offer has been made in the second search.
Failed searches can happen in any department, primarily because the question of ""fit"" is a really difficult one to work out in advance of actually going through the process.  Searching is a process, not a ready-made formula.  In any case, with respect to Hopkins, they've made a whole slew of adventurous new faculty hires in a range of different fields this year.
A junior western medievalist is indeed listed for 2013-14 courses (N. Zchomelidse, formerly an assistant professor at Princeton); however, it appears that they were unable to fill the Byzantine position.
They made two junior hires in western medieval (not hearsay).

Curious if there's been any movement on these? (Oct. 13) I haven't heard a thing other than the request to fill out the EO data (Oct. 30 x 3)
Position 1: First Round Interview: (none)
Position 1 Rejection:  Check. (honestly, did they send rejection letters out already?) -- I don't know about letters, but finalists for the first position were notified that an offer was made. 
Position 1 Campus Interview:

First round of campus visits is underway. A second round is supposed to take place in the spring.
(11/19) Thank you for posting that- do you know if the present interviews are for the Medieval line or the Byzantine line? or are they interviewing both Med. and Byz. at the same time?
It seems they are looking at tenure-level people first (in both Med. and Byz.). Presumably they will turn their attention to junior people in the spring. [Thank you again for posting this! you've saved me, and I'm sure others, from a dark winter full of needless anxiety and speculation.]
Position 1 Offer:  An offer has been made (Out of curiousity, Western Medieval or Byzantine?). -- Western.
Position 2 First Interview: (My guess is that there won't be a skype/conference interview given their past practices)
Any news on the second position? Yes, any news on anything?
Position 2 Campus Interview:   Invitations to junior candidates have been extended. (Congrats to those invited and break a leg!)
Position 2 Offer: (any final news on this?) x2 [yeah, whatever happened with these- is it really true they both failed?] Failed search for position 1. Position 1 did not fail. -- Search for a tenured scholar failed. The Position 1 hire was made at the Assistant level (though the person is very established and deserves tenure by any reasonable standards). 
Do you know for a fact that the senior search ""failed,"" or just that they are having to recalibrate? 

Recalibrate? It'll take a little more than that. As the saying goes, 'there's no such thing as a failed search, only a failed department.'  
The suggestion that JHU's department has failed is ridiculous on it's face. ""recalibration"" might be a euphemism for ""go to candidate number 2."" Because no one has confirmed that the search has in fact ""failed."" 
It is a tried and true axiom: given the incredible wealth of talent nowadays in any pool, there is no excuse that any open rank search should fail other than departmental dysfunction, even should they initially give offers to senior candidates who use and decline offers simply to get a raise at their present institution. 
Just because the search for position one may have failed (and many signs point to yes), does not mean that the search for position two will fail. However, if both searches fail that seems to send some disturbing signals about the department. 
Does anyone know what's happening re: the search for the junior position, and whether an offer has been extended? 
An offer has been made in the second search.
Failed searches can happen in any department, primarily because the question of ""fit"" is a really difficult one to work out in advance of actually going through the process.  Searching is a process, not a ready-made formula.  In any case, with respect to Hopkins, they've made a whole slew of adventurous new faculty hires in a range of different fields this year.
A junior western medievalist is indeed listed for 2013-14 courses (N. Zchomelidse, formerly an assistant professor at Princeton); however, it appears that they were unable to fill the Byzantine position.
They made two junior hires in western medieval (not hearsay).

Could you clarify the rationale for this suggestion?
'Early Modern' art is conventionally understood to cover the period ca.1350-1750 (i.e Renaissance, Baroque, and often 18th Century). This ad uses that label, but calls for a candidate whose expertise runs from ca.1750-1950

First Interview: CAA interview scheduled 1/18 (x2).
I was contacted 1/18 as well, but I couldn't attend CAA due to financial limits; when I told UNLV, they said perhaps they'd contact me if they didn't have enough CAA interviews from their short list. I emailed them the week after CAA to ask if I could still have a long-distance interview and I've never heard from them. I deduce from this that they are not very worried about discriminating against people based on their socio-economic status and in all honesty, I don't want to work for a school like that anyway (3/6).

Many thanks for the update!
Does this also mean that all of the senior candidates have been contacted? One would assume yes at this point. 
Have junior-level candidates been contacted? I would also assume yes at this point as well.  Word on the streets is that this not a jr. level search and aren't interviewing anyone jr. (1/30). I heard the same (1/30)  If this is true, I wish they wouldn't have waisted junior candidates time by posting it as an open position. (1/31) previous poster: ""open rank"" is always code for senior. (2/6) Word on the street: they will try to hire sr. first (since they don't have many sr. faculty right now, but sr. facutly don't always want to move institutions). If that doesn't work or they don't find the right fit, they'll move on to Associate and perhaps Assistant. I don't think it was a question of wasting folks' time but rather not knowing what fish were in the sea (and how things would unfold). (2/7) Word is there are 2 (quasi-) power couples being courted. If this is a determined strategy, armchair opinion is the search will fail. (2/18) As a former grad student at USC, I have to say the previous comment could not be more on the mark. When I was a student there several attempts at getting senior scholars, especially couples, to teach in the dept. ended up failing; the dept. could really use several more junior scholars, but they seem determined to focus on senior scholars (2/19). That's what happens when senior scholars leave.

We welcome applications from scholars who take an inter-regional perspective, as well as more focused research within a single region and/or cultural tradition, in a broad geographical area ranging from the Atlantic ocean to the Caspian sea, encompassing Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and West Asia. We are particularly interested in attracting applicants with innovative conceptual approaches to their field, whatever their sub-field may be, and who are committed to connecting their area of specialty to larger intellectual and methodological frameworks that cut across field and disciplines. The department has recently reorganized itself with this goal in mind; see: http://www.haa.pitt.edu/research/constellations-foundations . The starting date is September 1, 2013.
The department is also committed to outstanding teaching at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Applicants should be interested in teaching as an intellectual enterprise in its own right, and should be able to teach outside their immediate specialization.
Questions may be addressed to Prof. Katheryn Linduff, Acting Chair (linduff@pitt.edu) until December 31, and after that to Prof. Barbara McCloskey (bmcc@pitt.edu).
Appointment depends on budgetary approval.
PhD and teaching experience are required. Applications are due no later than December 1 and should be sent electronically as a single PDF file to Natalie Swabb (njs21@pitt.edu). The file should include a cover letter that includes a research statement, your cv, a brief teaching portfolio (max 20 pages), and a writing sample or publication. Three letters of recommendation should be sent separately to the Department Chair, Department of the History of Art and Architecture, 104 FKART, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260.
First Round Interview: email to schedule skype interview. [posted 1/22]
Why did somebody delete the previous posts?

Only one person using this wiki received an interview? Every other job has had its status confirmed by several participants. It seems strange that there was so much delay [as was noted and then deleted above], then a skype interview for this position instead of CAA interviews, and that almost two weeks after it was posted no one has seconded it.
Well, hopefully I wasn't catfished. The schedule of possible interview times had 10 slots, presumably for ten candidates. 
No one has seconded Arizona either. It doesn't mean anything.
good call.

First Interview:

Any news on this one? (No 1/8; No 1/25 x2)
Another poster deleted my earlier comment, so I'll rephrase it as a question: does anybody believe there is still a chance here? I'm under the impression that this ship has sailed. I have no inside information; it's just that November 1 was a long time ago, this is an open rank search, etc. Thoughts? (and please don't delete others' comments!) 1/26  
I applied to see if I could get a practice interview, since I assume they will choose the candidate in advance and then hold a mock competition . . . My assumption is that if you need to ask, you probably aren't the one.  This is only based on how I think things work at Ivies -- no inside knowledge.  1/26
Keep in mind that they have three searches going on right now, two of them open rank, plus graduate admissions -- so it's more likely that the committees are simply buried in files than that they have already determined their favorites. If they invite you for an interview at any stage, you can trust that they are sincerely interested in what you have to offer. (If there's one generalization I can make about the Ivies, or at least this department, it's that they tend not to waste their time on sham interviews.) (1/27)
Received email stating that review of applications is still in process. 1/29 (x5) etc?
as a prior grad student in this dept, I think that they will hire senior, not junior, and that they frequently invite ""guest lecturers"" to campus beyond the scope of any active searches, and make sure students show up.  these are the true candidates.  however, I agree, as above poster stated, they do sincerely invite people they are interested in from the ""pile.""  And truly engage with the work.  It is an honor, but it will not land you a job, but rather, an opportunity down the road. IMHO.  (2/6)
skype interview scheduled 2/17
Anyone else scheduled for an interview, or just this one?  Odd that this and one of their other searches seem to show one skype interview each--and the third seach has no evidence of interviews at all.  Perhaps it's all happening at a level above Wiki traffic. (2/27)

It would make the Wiki a lot less creepy if people from Yale would stop updating Yale listings from on campus. Yes, I realize this may be a student, in which case we appreciate the information you are sharing, but this is the second or third post of this sort this year in Art History alone (and at least one of the others was really shilling for the department). Cool it, kids, we get it.
Are you kidding? I'm extremely grateful that someone has graciously been posting, otherwise we'd all be consumed with anxiety longer than neccessary throughout this process. It's great that is reliable and from someone from the actual institution, and even better that someone there is aware of the perceptions/prejudgices/jealousies in academia of elite Ivies as closed systems and old boys clubs. Still better that they can offer evidence to the contrary this year.
Fair enough. I've noticed two trends on the Wiki in recent years, neither of which (in my opinion) bodes well for its long term health -- a) less posting by the candidates themselves (including *much* less posting of their names, and erasing of names after they become public knowledge via department websites and course schedules -- you WANT this job, people, why take your name down once you have it, the negotiations are over, and the news is public?!); and b) a greater awareness and monitoring of the Wiki by search committees and department members. As long as the latter does nothing to chill open discussion by candidates -- the Wiki's primary purpose -- there's really nothing to object to, but for me, this year's Yale comments, particularly the one defending the departmental search practices as models of openness and virtue (despite plenty of anecdotal evidence to the contrary), have made me wonder whether departments are beginning to see it as their prerogative to post on their own searches. I don't *know* that's what's happening here -- as I said, it may well be a student -- but I have wondered, which, for me, has the chilling effect I'd prefer not to see.

I heard they made an offer to an ABD, 4/9/14
Correct. Although technically an ABD, the hire has been teaching for quite a while now.
Yes, an ABD with teaching experience who was also offered a postdoc 2013-14. Very qualified but lacking the PhD and significant [peer-reviewed] publications. I'm noticing a trend of ABD or TT-lateral moves, the rest are relegated to steerage. I wish I had thought of the strategy of keeping my degree ""fresh"" as well. My comment was mainly about the absurdities of the market.
I don't think in this particular case the ""freshness"" of the degree was the rationale behind the hire. My speculation is that the research agenda proposed and general profile spoke to the interests of the committee. Now, who frames architectural history discourse, and how this framing defines the market and what committees are looking for is a much more productive approach to understanding hires. This is my very personal and limited opinion.
Offer made but not accepted. Timothy Hyde, Associate Professor at the GSD, has accepted the position.

Applicants must be capable of teaching a wide range of courses (large lecture to seminar) at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

The campus is especially interested in candidates who can contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community through their research, teaching, and service.

The campus operates on a schedule of three 11-week quarters per academic year. In accordance with the departmentƒ??s workload policy, faculty members are required to offer the equivalent of 5 five-unit courses per year (which normally means teaching 4 courses over three quarters and carrying out other academic and service responsibilities), advise and mentor students, actively engage in research, and undertake administrative service for the department, affiliated college, and university. The ability to contribute significantly to graduate education and the mentoring of graduate students is highly desirable.
We have a strong undergraduate major and a young, dynamic Ph.D. program. Under the leadership of an energetic dean, our division is enjoying faculty growth, significant fundraising successes, new research centers, and is planning for a new Institute of the Arts and Sciences, which is one of the top four initiatives in the universityƒ??s comprehensive campaign. The Arts Division supports faculty research through the Arts Research Institute http://artsresearch.ucsc.edu/ari/ and the Arts Dean's Fund for Excellence; the campus supports research and teaching with grants awarded by the Committee on Research, the Committee on Teaching, and other groups.
RANK: Assistant Professor SALARY: Commensurate with qualifications and experience
BASIC QUALIFICATIONS: Ph.D. or equivalent degree in architecture studies/built environment or a related area (Ph.D. must be conferred by June 30, 2014).

POSITION AVAILABLE: July 1, 2014, with academic year beginning September 2014. Position contingent upon final budgetary approval.
TO APPLY: Applications are accepted via the UCSC Academic Recruit online system, and must include: 1) a letter of application outlining scholarly background as well as current and future research plans; 2) curriculum vitae; 3) a current publication or writing sample (chapter of dissertation if no publications); 4) descriptions or syllabi for three courses (one large lecture, one small lecture, one seminar); 5) three current confidential letters of recommendation.* The university welcomes applicantsƒ?? submission of a statement addressing their contributions to diversity through their research, service, and/or teaching.

Rejection: Email 12/20 (it stated that there were 109 applications).

I wonder if the reference to ""senior scholars"" was accidental?  ---> I wondered that too ---> It did not look accidental to me. --> Please elaboarate; I was contacted neither with an interview nor with a rejection and am not a senior scholar.  --> In the rejection, they wrote, ""The search committee reviewed 109 applications from an exceptionally talented group of senior scholars..."" I assume they meant junior scholars since it is a tenure-track position, but who knows? But unfortunately I wouldn't get your hopes up if you haven't heard anything. It looks like they conducted Skype interviews a couple weeks ago so have likely contacted their favored candidates.
Rejection: I received the same e-mail . The e-mail mentioned the overwhelming task of ""selecting finalists whose areas of expertise provided a good fit with our existing faculty.""

NOTES:

is there anyone else out there with no rejection letter and no request for an interview, or am i just a logistical mistake that fell through the cracks of academic adminstration? oh boy, the existential questioning this process stimulates... ps. people interviewing for Santa Cruz, i'm sorry i didn't provide you with a real update. i am only a self-indulgent full of entitlement academic in pursuit of camaraderie and some answers...
I also did not get an interview or a rejection, but am not holding out hope on this one. Probably either an administrative oversight or, more likely, a pool of people they are keeping in the mix just in case one of the first round interviews does not work out. 
I'm a faculty member in the department at UC Santa Cruz--we have an automated system that is set up to email applicants not chosen for interviews to notify them of our decision.  Based on the comments above, I assume that we have a glitch.  We made an offer that was accepted.  I apologize for the lack of notifications to some applicants.  I know how stressful it is to be on the market and am sorry for having inadvertantly added to your anxiety.

did anyone else who interviewed at CAA *not* receive an email stating that the position was filled?
I got the email stating that the position had been filled (obviously without a campus visit). I would check your spam mail - they have no reason to play games with candidates. It sounds as though the outgoing doyen hand-picked her successor - this has happened to me before. It is annoying to spend over $600 on an interview when the search appears to be a cover in the end. American searches are winding up just as rigged as the Italian ones these days! (though I could always be wrong - lack of transparency tends to fog the view.).
According the department's website, campus visits are happening this week (3/4). Maybe there was some miscommunication between the dean's office and the department--searches have so many moving parts.
The three finalists are listed on the department calendar: http://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/arts/events/?start_date=2014-03-03&no_search=1 (3/5/14)

(As an aside - I did not copy this from the MLAJobs tumblr. Is anyone else depressed by this posting?)
depressed because the candidate is expected to cover everything, teach all day, and still find time to research, or is something else bothering you?
If it's any comfort (at least the comfort offered by a moment of gallows humor), some may remember the listing from last year that described the ideal candidate as ""a Generalist with demonstrated expertise in a specialization.""
I'd like to see if they can find anyone who can teach all of those areas.  I got a good laugh from the job posting.

NOTES:

FYI this is a spousal job. Inside candidate is wife of new hire in South Asian art history.
Is this your own personal speculation, or coming from someone actually connected with the search? 
The t.t. S. Asianist got the department to secure a job for his wife, a modern S. Asian art historian, when he was hired. She was a lecturer in the department for a year and is now on a fellowship. UCB has to do a national search, but it is not legit.
Just a thought: what this would mean is that Berkeley, land of fiscal mismanagement, extreme budget cuts, programmatic cuts and no phones in faculty offices, somehow managed to secure a spousal hire for a) a newly minted PhD, b) whose spouse works in essentially the same field (i.e., S. Asia), c) in a market that has enjoyed a relative glut of excellent S. Asianists in the past several years, and d) in a overall academic environment that has seen spousal hires for all but the most elite senior hires essentially disappear. I have no knowledge of the specific situation, and would not deny that stacked searches leading to inside hires do occur. But as I've said repeatedly on this forum regarding rumors of rigged searches and inside hires (including searches in which I was the supposed insider, as well as ones in which I was an external finalist), I would urge those of you interested in this job not to give this rumor too much credence. However well intentioned the original poster is or how well informed they believe themselves to be, Berkeley is under no obligation to run a search to complete a spousal hire -- I would assume that this is legit unless the University somehow cuts the interview process obviously short on the way to hiring the spouse (i.e., no campus visits). In other words: apply, apply, apply.
Word.
In terms of UCB having to do a national search, I'm not sure. Lauren Kroiz was hired last year as an assistant prof. and I don't believe that Berkeley ran an Americanist search. I'm not entirely sure what happened there (she's a stellar scholar of course) but if she was hired without a search then I am sure Berkeley could do the same if they intended to make a spousal hire.
Indeed. Their Late Antique/Early Christian specialist was also a spousal hire (husband's in a different department), who was brought on with no search. I can't think of any place (especially a highly attractive school like Berkeley) that lets beginning assistant professors demand a t.t. place for their spouse in the same department -- and then conducts a nationwide search (which are hugely expensive, time-consuming enterprises) to cover it up. All this is to affirm: if you're interested, apply! And assume you will be taken seriously.
It is RIDICULOUS to suggest that Berkeley -- or any other university -- would conduct a sham search to masquerade an already-decided upon partner hire. Whoever thinks this has no knowledge of how things actually work. Partner hires are conducted without searches -- that was the case with Kroiz, whose husband teaches in a non-humanities field. The Global Modern art position is not a ""rigged"" partner hire; it is a legitimate and wide-open search for the top candidate in the field-- in fact, if you did your resaerch you might realize that it is a replacment position for TJ Clark, redefined by the department for a new era of art history. Search timings are completely up to the administration and are often subject to their decisions and whims. This precise position had been requested long ago, but it was only recently authorized. Wild speculations and ostensibly ""insider"" gossip on this wiki do everyone a disservice.
^ That's simply not true. Julia Bryan-Wilson was hired as a Modernist to replace both Anne Wagner and T.J. Clark. Realistically speaking, this was probably because Berkeley didn't have the money at the time to hire two candidates. Before their retirements, Wagner and Clark generally split dissertations on 20th century Western art, with Wagner supervising contemporary/neo-avantgarde/postmodern dissertations, and Clark supervising work on the historical avantgarde/modernism from the 19th century to around 1950. In both cases, however, they were working in a very specifically Western context. To suggest that Berkeley's search for a candidate working in ""cross-cultural, colonial and postcolonial, transnational, and ƒ??worldƒ? contexts"" is a search to replace T.J. Clark doesn't make sense. The department could really benefit from a good Western Modernist scholar, say late 19th century - mid twentieth, but this is not that search. 
As the poster above noted, the position has been ""redefined by the department for a new era of art history."" The department is not looking to replace Clark himself (how could they?) or even the specific range of things he taught, but rather to fill the *line* that was vacated when he left and that the university could not afford to fill at the time JBW was hired. I'm so glad to see that they are doing this search at last, and expanding the department's breadth -- it's going to be an exciting time to be there.
re: ""RIDICULOUS"" - no, it is most certainly NOT ridiculous to suggest that they might conduct such a search. I am an associate faculty at a flagship public R1 university and I know of a similar situation taking place right now now at our university in an allied department. It's probably not a ""sham"" search in the sense that they know in advance who they're going to hire, but it may very well be ""rigged"" in the sense that they know it would be best if they were able to make an offer to a particular person. It's extraordinarily rare for an assistant professor, straight out of grad school, to get a spousal hire in the humanities. But it's fairly common for one to get a visiting lecturer position for their spouse, with that lectureship then ""turning into"" a tenure-track hire after the department begs the administration for a new search, lest they risk losing their great new hire. It's just standard university politics. 
It certainly looks like this position is intended as a spousal hire, particularly with the very precise wording of the call, which carefully notes that they welcome applications from international scholars.Looks like this was written with the inside candidate in mind.
The spouse in question completed her doctorate at the University of Minnesota; I'm not sure if I would count that as ""international.""
I think that ""international"" refers to non-U.S. citizens, such as the spouse in question, regardless of where she did she did her grad work.
Most of the people here giving you the ""inside scoop"" about spousal hires and hiring priorities have never been on a hiring committee and don't actually know how things work. That is why they are eagerly reading the wikis, just like you and me. Take it all with a grain of salt.
At the end of the day this was not a spousal hire; Dr. Anneka Lenssen is listed as teaching in the Fall '14 departmental course announcement. A lot of worry and gnashing of teeth could have been avoided if people had trusted Berkeley to run a fair search.

Any news? (1/24) Has there been an offer? (4/3)
contacted for campus visit, noting a 'slot opened up', but declined as I have accepted another offer (3/19)
did they ever send out rejection letters? (5/8) Never received a rejection letter, has anyone been hired? (5/16)
apparently yes. If it makes anybody feel better, this is a very dysfunctional department. The previous head of art history never published much, but used her job to jump-start her career as a writer of romance novels. This is her website (  http://www.madelinehunter.com/  )   Note the airbrushed photo, if compared to this: http://www.duq.edu/academics/schools/liberal-arts/academic-departments-of-liberal-arts/history/faculty-and-staff . The current position was supposedly done to replace the previous Modernist, a -tenured- ""assistant"" professor.  The search committee consisted of two people: a tenure-track (3rd year) assistant professor of Art History and another -tenured- assistant professor, this time in History.
Regarding the note above this one, it sounds like someone close to the department is suffering from indigestion due to sour grapes and a thwarted sense of entitlement. If he/she did not land the job, perhaps it was due to a clear lack of professionalism.

This should be a search for a 19th-century specialist, since they already have Megan Luke for Modern European art. Does anybody know more about it?
I know they made an offer to Michael Leja last year but it fell through. They're looking for a high-ranking scholar to enter with tenure (despite their open rank call). Most likely a replacement for Richard Meyer.
Is this search complete? Looks like they hired someone for the fall, according to their webpage.
I don't know, but that announcement has been posted on their website for at least a couple of months.
Word is that their 2nd hiring attempt fell through as well. 
Does anyone know, then, if they still plan to try to fill the position in this hiring cycle?

The Art Department at Utah State University seeks qualified candidates for a tenure-track position as an assistant professor in art history with a specialization in modern and/or American art. The successful candidate will demonstrate teaching experience in both western art history survey and upper-division courses, excellence in research, and a commitment to developing a small but promising art history and visual studies program in the context of a multi-disciplinary art department in the Caine College of the Arts at Utah State University.
The department currently offers undergraduate degrees in art education, art history, ceramics, graphic design, interior design, painting and drawing, photography, printmaking, and sculpture. A small number of MFA students are admitted each year to selective programs in the art practice fields. The college is committed to excellence across its four units: theater, music, art and design, and the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art. USU is known as a regional hub for the arts, and is the home to the stateƒ??s only resident string quartet, an annual opera festival, and one of the largest fine-arts museum collections in the Intermountain West.

This will be the primary field of evaluation for the probationary period and for advancement in rank and tenure. Teaching responsibilities include a 2/3 course load covering an introductory art history survey of western art from the Renaissance to the modern period, upper division lecture/discussion and seminar courses in her or his area of research specialization, and the MFA seminar on contemporary issues in art criticism and theory.

NOTES:
This is a **rigged** search to hire a current, long-term VAP. Don't waste your time.

If I had a penny for every time someone cried ""rigged search,"" when the search turned out not to be so, I'd have like fifty pennies. The perceived advantages of being a VAP (faculty know you, you're on home turf) are counter-balanced by the disadvantages (faculty know you, you're on home turf). Don't listen to the nay-sayers and the conspiracy theorists: apply, apply, and apply. 
While I generally agree with the above, as someone who now makes faculty hires (seen it from both sides) and as someone who knows a little something about this department in particular, I do not discount the ""rigged"" comment here. As in every case, nothing is black and white. But, in this case, the shades of gray all point to a ""rigged"" search. So, apply but know you are going up against this VAP who will give you a run for your money.
Let's not get too picky here: remember that the VAP may not accept the job if they offer it. All searches are dynamic until they are over.
As someone (not in ancient) who was the purported ""inside"" candidate for a TT job that I did not get, I cannot disagree more with the suggestion that such searches are ƒ??rigged.ƒ? Being an ƒ??inside candidateƒ? carries with a number of positives, but an even larger number of negatives. All searches ultimately come down to that terribly squishy notion of ƒ??fitƒ? between candidate and institution. It is foolish for anyone to think that an outcome can be preordained when it is predicated upon such fuzzy ideas.  
What a bizarre statement. Why wouldn't the VAP take the job? If s/he does, we should take heart that a long term VAP was finally hired. Se often VAPs, postdocs, lecturors, and adjuncts are exploited, paid poorly, and as the years roll by watch thier liklihood of landing a t.t. job take a nose dive. Sounds like U.F. is doing right by this VAP, as should more institutions.   
UPDATE, Fall 2015. Looks like this was correct. Rigged search.

NOTES:

Anyone heard anything after CAA?
I have not been contacted and since CAA was so long ago, I am sure I won't. I am not surprised. During my CAA interview, the committee pointedly informed me that they really needed to ""diversify"" their department, in order to bring in more diverse students (numbers of students is apparently not an issue). That of course does not mean diversity in classes/ subjects. It means minority candidate. The other general Asian job this year went the same way. Tokens, tokens, get your tokens!  
Wrote to them asking if they had contacted folks for second round interviews, they said they would be contacting people at the end of the month (March).

The School of Philosophy and Art History at the University of Essex is pleased to invite applications for a post with the rank of Lecturer (with eligibility for permanency), Senior Lecturer, or Reader. We are well represented in 20th and 21st century art and visual culture, and particularly seek someone with expertise in the history of art, architecture, and/or visual culture between the dates of 1300 and 1850.
You will be expected to carry out a vigorous programme of independent research, to contribute broadly to teaching and supervision activities within the School, and to participate in the usual range of administrative duties. Essential qualifications for the post include: a PhD (or one awaiting examination) in Art History or a related discipline, or equivalent professional experience; evidence of research excellence; experience of teaching in a higher education environment or the demonstrable potential for excellence in teaching.
Essex Art History is part of the School of Philosophy and Art History, a community of academics who share a common project of researching and teaching art and ideas. We were ranked in the top ten in the last UK Research Assessment Exercise, and eleventh nationally in the Complete University Guide 2015. We offer a wide range of courses for undergraduates, taught postgraduates and doctoral research students in an environment that emphasises collaboration and collegiality for both research and teaching. The University is home to the largest public collection of Latin American art in Europe (http://www.escala.org.uk ) and a campus gallery called Art Exchange. We also have strong links with regional visual arts organisations including Firstsite (http://www.firstsite.uk.net ) in Colchester.
Essex Art History features a dynamic group of art historians who investigate the production and reception of images and built environments, across cultures and media from the early modern period to the present. While we adopt a diverse range of approaches in our writing and teaching, our work demonstrates a commitment to three key ideas:
1. The social and political implications of art, architecture, and visual culture.
All forms of visual culture ƒ?? from paintings to building interiors, from medical imagery to tattoos ƒ?? emerge from and contribute to the mediation of social and political forces. Scholars at Essex investigate the role of art and visual culture in the assertion, negotiation, and contestation of power in relation to a variety of topics, including the planning of tyrantsƒ?? cities in the Italian Renaissance; the entanglement of the historical avant-garde with the politics of Fascism; and the production of objects by contemporary activists in pursuit of social change. Throughout our work, we emphasise issues of autonomy, agency, dissent, and the contestation of the public realm.
2. Space, place, and locale.
Art historians at Essex are strongly concerned with the conceptualisation, production, experience, and representation of spaces and places. We investigate topics that include the ideologies that drive urban change; architectural metaphors in software design; the fusion of real and imaginary places in religious paintings; the design of exhibition spaces and the implications of curatorial practice; and the varied locales and landscapes of the county of Essex itself.
3. Art produced beyond its historic institutions.
We are committed to bringing the approaches of art history into contact with other disciplines and discourses in order to interrogate objects of our shared visual and material culture, including body art, medical illustrations, wax casts, activist placards, and Fascist floor mosaics. Our trans disciplinary approach facilitates critical engagement with an array of works of art and visual culture that stand both within and beyond the traditional canons of art history.

The particular sub-fields and time periods for this position are open to all Brazilian, Spanish Latin American, and Caribbean art, architecture and visual culture. Specialists in early modern, modern and contemporary are encouraged to apply. We are particularly interested in scholars who would approach the subject through non-traditional approaches to visual culture and the built environment, and who would capitalize on new theoretical models relating to gender and embodiment in traditional or contemporary art, urban planning, arts and cultural literacy in the construction of a Brazilian or Latin American social imaginary, contemporary art practices and their relationship to memory and tradition, and/or varied architectural responses to Western building techniques and ideologies. We can also envision courses that examine the historical dimensions of Brazilian, Spanish Latin American, and Caribbean cultures and their expression in art and architecture, as well as the conditions and experiences of artists developing their work in the contemporary Latin American postƒ??colonial state.
Applicants will have received a Ph.D. within the past five (5) years from an institution other than Brown in the fields of Brazilian, Spanish Latin American or Caribbean art, architecture or visual culture. Cogut fellows will participate in the activities of the Center and teach two courses each year (cross-listed in each of our departments, as appropriate). The term of the fellowship is two years.
Stipend: $61,449 and $63,907 in the first and second years plus a $2,000 research fund.

I have heard nothing. x4
I called about a week ago and they said they are still reviewing applications.
Still nothing (12/10) -- can the person who called let us know what the date of your call was
^^ I'm not the poster who called but for what it's worth: I applied to a Gallatin position once before and remember that it took them a long while to move forward.12/10
As this is an ""open field"" call, they no doubt received a mountain of applications. Since they also ask for a writing sample and rec letters, they will also have a lot of documents to read through. That doesn't make the wait any less frustrating, but it's not too surprising it's taking more time.
I'm the one who called. I don't remember the exact date but it was about two weeks ago and they said they would be reviewing applications for a few more weeks.
Thanks! ^^ Good of you to call and then report here.

The Department of History of Art and Architecture (HAA) at the University of Pittsburgh and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (CMP) are strongly committed to excellence in research, and to inclusive curatorial and teaching practices that promote collaboration, diversity, and expanding our public outreach.  To further our leadership in these areas we seek to hire a Lecturer in Curatorial Studies who will work both as a scholar-teacher in HAAƒ??s dynamic art history department and as a curator with the unique cross-disciplinary collections of the Carnegie Museums. This appointment is the result of a major grant given to HAA by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, for the purpose of creating a collaborative consortium between HAA and museums in the Pittsburgh region.  The appointment is for four years, starting September 1, 2015, and is outside the tenure stream, but may be renewable pending budget authorization. 
HAA and CMP are committed to the study and understanding of art and artifacts across the world from the ancient to the contemporary.  HAA has a strong record of research productivity in the arts and architecture of East Asia, South Asia, the ancient Mediterranean, Europe from the Middle Ages to the present, the Americas, and global contemporary art.  The department also has a highly innovative ƒ??Constellationsƒ? PhD program, an active University Art Gallery with its own curator, and a Visual Media Workshop that serves as a hub for Digital Humanities research and collaboration at the University of Pittsburgh: http://www.haa.pitt.edu. CMP encompasses four museums: Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Science Center, and The Andy Warhol Museum:http://www.carnegiemuseums.org. The Warhol is home to an internationally renowned collection of artworks by Andy Warhol, along with archival holdings of approximately 500,000 objects. The Museum of Artƒ??s collection of more than 35,000 objects features a broad spectrum of visual arts, including painting and sculpture; prints and drawings; photographs; architectural casts, renderings, and models; decorative arts and design; and film, video, and digital imagery. It also houses the archive of nearly 80,000 negatives by photographer Charles ƒ??Teenieƒ? Harris. The Natural History Museumƒ??s collection comprises 22 million objects and scientific specimens used to broaden understanding of evolution, conservation, and biodiversity. Its anthropological collection of 1.6 million ethnological and historical specimens and archaeological artifacts includes major research collections from Central Africa, Asia (China and Japan), Australia, North America (Arctic, Southwest, Plains, Northwest Coast), and South America (Amazonia), as well as other notable collections.
We welcome applications from scholar-curators across the entire scope of our collections and areas of inquiry, from the disciplines of art history, anthropology, and material culture. We are particularly interested in attracting applicants who take innovative approaches to their field, and who are committed to connecting their area of specialty to larger intellectual frameworks that cut across fields and disciplines and that contribute in compelling ways to the broad mission of the public humanities.  HAAƒ??s Constellations program was recently put into place with this goal in mind.  CMP has also undertaken parallel initiatives, such as establishing art-science ƒ??Nexus Projectsƒ? that leverage the museumsƒ?? collective assets and recruiting a Public Fellow through the American Council of Learned Societies. 
The successful candidate will have home bases in HAA and CMP.  The individual will teach one course per year in HAAƒ??s thriving undergraduate museum studies program, which draws students not only from art history and studio arts, but also from history, anthropology, and other disciplines in the Arts & Sciences.  The Lecturer in Curatorial Studies will work collaboratively with students and faculty from HAA and other departments at the university interested in teaching and research with the collections at CMP; and will facilitate internships and other experiential learning opportunities for students.  The individual will also devote 50% of the position time serving as Assistant/Associate Curator (depending on qualifications) in CMP with a home base in one museum while helping to foster connections across CMPƒ??s collections and programs.  S/he will be expected to contribute to one larger exhibition and/or to create smaller, experimental exhibitions, some of these working with undergraduates in HAAƒ??s museum studies program, at a range of potential venues including CMP and the University Art Gallery.
PHD or equivalent combination of training and practice such as an MA/ MFA with related research, curatorial, and teaching experience is expected.  Applications are due no later than April 10, 2015 and should be sent electronically as a single PDF file to HAA Administrative Assistant, Molly Sabol at mks89@pitt.edu.  The file should have a cover letter that includes a research and teaching statement and discusses the applicantƒ??s approach to museum curation and the opportunities afforded by this joint appointment.  It should also include a curriculum vitae, list of three references, brief teaching portfolio, description of the applicantƒ??s museum experience, and a writing sample or publication.
Salary and benefits will be paid by the University of Pittsburgh; annual evaluations of the employee will be conducted by the Chair of HAA and the Chief Curator  (or equivalent) of the home museum at CMP.

THIS IS A BOGUS SEARCH, DONT WAST YOUR TIME APPLYING. ITS GOING TO THE INSIDE CANDIDATE WHO HAS BEEN TEACHING THERE FOR YEARS. 
Just because there's an inside candidate doesn't mean it's a ""bogus search"" or a waste of time. On the contrary, not applying would be a wasted opportunity. There's always a chance the inside person is not the shoo-in you assume her to be -- and even if she is, at least you've had a chance to get your work into the hands of the committee. Take all occasions to let people know who you are, even if you're a long shot!
True, this is a good opportunity to network. But, I know the search chair and it is a pity that the dean insisited that they do a search at all. 
I couldn't agree more. I've seen many searches where there is a presumed choice (either an inside or outside candidate) that shifts direction when a shinier object enters the room. Even if there's an inside candidate, people should apply anyway.

Connecticut College seeks applications for a tenure-track position in the Department of Art History and Architectural Studies beginning in fall 2016. The successful candidate will have expertise in the history of architecture and urbanism. The sub-specialty is open, but preference will be given to scholars whose focus is architecture and urbanism after 1800. Applicants must have a Ph.D. in art history or a related field, a strong commitment to undergraduate teaching and an active research program.
The successful candidate will be conversant with current theoretical approaches and eager to highlight theory across the spectrum of courses to be taught: the survey of Western architecture from the Renaissance to the present, intermediate electives, and advanced seminars. The Department of Art History and Architectural Studies is committed to interdisciplinarity, and the major program in Architectural Studies is its most broadly interdisciplinary component: about 70% of the elective courses that can fulfill requirements for the major in Architectural Studies are offered by departments and programs other than Art History and Architectural Studies. The candidate will offer courses that contribute to the collegeƒ??s new Connections program.
Recognizing that intellectual vitality and diversity are inseparable, the College is continuing with what has been a very successful initiative to diversify its faculty, student body and curriculum. The College seeks creative scholars excited about working in a liberal arts setting, with its strong focus on engaged teaching, participation in shared governance, and active involvement in an institution-wide advancement of diversity.
The Collegeƒ??s commitment to excellence in teaching is manifest in the programs on campus devoted to issues of pedagogy, in particular those of the Joy Shechtman Mankoff Center for Teaching and Learning. Equally important to both the department and the College are the prospects for and the encouragement of faculty research, from small grants-in-aid to subsidizing student collaboration on faculty projects. The generous sabbatical policy (for every six semesters of teaching, one semester of leave at 80% of salary) affords further opportunity for research and writing.
Tenure-track faculty teach a 3-2 load, 2-2 in the first year. In addition to providing all faculty with strong ongoing support for teaching and research, the College offers these resources for pre-tenured faculty: a summer stipend for the first two years, a supplementary research fund, and a semesterƒ??s sabbatical after a successful third-year review. AA/EEO.
Applicants should submit: (1) a CV, with the names and contact information of three references. Letters of reference should be sent directly to the Interfolio address listed below; (2) a cover letter of not more than two pages stating research interests, teaching philosophy, and two proposed course titles; (3) a sample syllabus; and (4) teaching evaluations, if available, to Joseph D. Alchermes, Chair of Art History and Architectural Studies, at: apply.interfolio.com/30675.  The appointment begins July 1, 2016.

I'm 99% sure ""Darby"" isn't correct--my understanding is that he was re-hired for a different position, and now they're looking for a senior, early 20th-century scholar.
Yeah, Darby was already teaching again in the department prior to the application cutoff. Wouldn't make sense for this search to be for him, though it is very possible they have another specific candidate in mind.

Situated within the Division of Arts and Humanities at UC San Diego, Department of Visual Arts http://visarts.ucsd.edu
UC San Diego is committed to academic excellence and diversity among its faculty, staff, and student body
We seek a teacher and scholar of medieval art history in Italy and the Mediterranean from late antiquity to the dawn of the Renaissance, including the Byzantine and Islamic Middle East, for a Teaching Professor position of high rank in a department with undergraduate majors in art history, media, studio, interdisciplinary computing and speculative design, and graduate programs leading to the Masters of Fine Arts and the PhD in art and media history, theory and criticism, including a PhD concentration in art practice. Applicants must have distinguished academic record, with outstanding teaching and significant administrative experience in university and professional service, and be of sufficient national and international stature to attract outstanding PhD students in his or her field of specialization.
At UC San Diego, the primary academic responsibilities of teaching professors are pedagogy and service. The teaching professor in medieval art history will be asked to design and offer courses for university students at all levels of education, from first year undergraduates to MFA and PhD students, to contribute to instructional related activities and curriculum development, and to assume a significant role in administrating our pedagogical programs. Undergraduate teaching assignments may include introductory humanities and art history survey courses, upper-division lecture courses and seminars, and independent studies. We also expect this teaching professor to be an important member of graduate faculty offering PhD seminars in art history, serving on doctoral committees in Visual Arts and other Arts and Humanities departments, mentoring PhD students in medieval art and in other art history specializations, and working with MFA students as well.
Priority will be given to applicants of demonstrated excellence in teaching and instructional related activities, including the professional development of recent PhDs, considerable experience in faculty administration (such as service as department chair and / or on major university committees or the boards of professional organizations), and outstanding professional achievement and activity, including established ties with significant art historical organizations and research institutions, as well as a wide range of contacts with leading scholars in his/her own and related fields. 
Applicants for this position are expected to have a C.V. commensurate with its senior rank.

The Department of History of Art and Architecture at the University of Pittsburgh is strongly committed to excellence in research, and to inclusive teaching and curatorial practices that promote collaboration, diversity, and expanding our interdisciplinary presence and public outreach. To further our leadership in these areas we seek to hire an Academic Curator, pending budgetary approval.  As a tenure-track faculty member in an academic department (HAA), the Academic Curator will be a dynamic individual working to advance the teaching and research missions of the department in collaboration with a range of academic and museum partners. The Academic Curator will play a key role in coordinating the initiatives of the Pittsburgh Constellations Consortium, a working group of local museum collections and academic departments spearheaded by HAA, which has been launched by a large grant from the A.W. Mellon Foundation.
In addition to fostering collaborative research, the Academic Curatorƒ??s duties will include: supervising the academic internship program of HAA, which places graduate and undergraduate interns in projects sponsored by Consortium partners; teaching two courses per year in HAA and its museum studies minor, at least one of which will focus on professionalization; leading a week-long faculty and grad student summer workshop using Consortium collections (these workshops are supported by Mellon funding for the next three years [2016-2018]); and maintaining a scholarly research profile in the applicantƒ??s field through peer-reviewed publications, which may be collaborative and co-authored, and may include digital elements and community engagement as significant components.
Since this is a new type of academic position in a university department, HAA is open to candidates with a variety of training paths. A Ph.D. is required, in art history or a related field, as is teaching experience at the university level, along with a strong interest in pedagogy inside and outside the classroom. We also anticipate candidates will have significant curatorial and/or museum experience.
The ideal candidate is expected to have a well-developed area of research expertise, but also broad intellectual interests crossing fields and disciplines, a wide-ranging knowledge of professional museum practices, and proficiency in the digital environment. The position requires strong interpersonal and organizational skills, excellent oral and written communication abilities, and the wherewithal to collaborate effectively and collegially across disciplines and manage multiple projects and deadlines independently.
This appointment will begin September 1, 2016. Applications are due no later than December 15, 2015 and should be sent electronically as a single PDF file to HAA Administrative Assistant, Corrin Trombley (cot12@pitt.edu; phone: 412.648.2400).  The file should have a cover letter that includes a research and teaching statement and discusses how this appointment furthers the applicantƒ??s professional goals.  It should also include a curriculum vitae, three letters of reference*, a brief teaching portfolio, a description of the applicantƒ??s curatorial/museum experience, and a writing sample or publication.

School of Art History, Salary: ?œ38,896 - ?œ47,801 per annum, Fixed Term: 5 years in the first instance, Start: 1 September 2016 or as soon as possible thereafter
Details: We are seeking to appoint a full-time lecturer in Iranian Islamic Art History. Applications are invited from candidates whose research interests lie broadly within the spectrum of the Islamic art and/or architecture of the Iranian world, broadly defined. Candidates will therefore be expected to have the centre of gravity of their research squarely in the Iranian world in the Islamic period. Evidence of breadth of interest within the field of Iranian Islamic art and/or architecture is highly desirable, and a firm grounding in Iranian studies generally (e.g. in the fields of language, history, literature, religion) will be an advantage. (Please note that we are not seeking a candidate who is interested in Iranian Islamic art as an offshoot of another field.)  
You should already have, or be close to completing, a Ph.D.  You should be able to provide evidence of your research abilities in the form of publications of internationally-recognized quality as well as a programme of on-going research that will contribute to our reputation as one of the leading Art History departments in the UK (we were ranked 2nd among Art History departments in REF 2014). Other indications of research activity (e.g. grants awarded, conference papers delivered, exhibitions organized) will also be taken into account, as will evidence that your research has had or will have an impact beyond academia.  
You will be expected to offer attractive and accessible undergraduate courses on Iranian art and/or architecture, giving students as much first-hand experience of works as possible. You will also be required to contribute lectures on our first and/or second-year survey modules, which currently deal with the development of Western art, architecture and ideas. Working with postgraduates, both teaching M.Litt. classes and supervising Ph.D. research, will also be a vital part of your role. More broadly, it is expected that the successful candidate will participate in the activities of the Institute of Iranian Studies at the University of St Andrews. 
This is a fixed term post for 5 years in the first instance, with possibility of extension. Informal enquiries can be directed to Dr Julian Luxford: 01334 462394 or jml5@st-andrews.ac.uk. We prefer applicants to apply online at:  www.vacancies.st-andrews.ac.uk/welcome.aspx

They just hired a new South Asian art historian last year! Does anyone know the inside scoop with this one???
Oh boy, where to start...
Please, do shed some light. I wonder if I should even apply (I'm ABD). I found the thread for last year's posting on this position. Wild! 
FYI: Word is that it is another inside job. But, you never know... always apply!
Like the original poster, I too am skeptical...but I understand that recent faculty shifts (at least one of them last minute) mean that this might not necessarily be the in-job as its late posting date would imply.  (for what it's worth; my info is second-hand)

NOTES:

Any info on this job? It was posted (somewhere) Dec 7 but not to CAA, etc. until quite a bit later I believe, and they have scheduled interviews as of the day application reviews started? There is a scholar in this position on their website: have they left? Is there an inside candidate? Quite odd. 
1/25: There's no inside candidate from what I can tell (unusually--for this year's cycle anyway). The person in that position appears to be inactive within the department. Based on the information I was given, it seems that they desire a medievalist who can also teach ancient Greece and Rome, and the survey (which they explain in the advert). And, I think the recent post in CAA was a repost from earlier (maybe?). I saw it on another website as well. 
2/3 In preliminary interviews they said they would be quickly making decisions about finalists for campus visits. I'm assuming they've done that by now. Can anyone confirm?

The Department of Art History and Archaeology at Washington University in St. Louis, and the Saint Louis Art Museum seek a specialist in one of two broad fields, either in Islamic Art, or Art of the Ancient Americas, for a joint teaching-curatorial two-year position beginning July 1, 2017 (start date could be moved slightly later). Candidates will be interviewed in both subfields, but only one fellow will be selected from the total pool. The fellow will spend two semesters at Washington University in the Fall of 2017 and Spring of 2019, teaching two courses in each of those semesters. The fellow will spend the twelve-month period of 2018 working full-time at the Saint Louis Art Museum (SLAM) as an A. W.

If the successful fellow is a specialist in Islamic Art, she or he will teach an introductory-level course that will broadly address the field of Islamic Art; other classes may focus on traditions of miniature painting, the sacred arts of Islam, or the visual arts of Persia (Safavid) and/or India (Mughal). A course on modern or contemporary art in the Islamic world may be considered. At SLAM, a fellow in Islamic art may catalogue and interpret a collection of 50 works on paper and related objects, primarily from Persia and India in the Safavid and Mughal periods. Scholarly expertise in these areas is highly desired, but other areas will be considered. The fellow will curate the current gallery spaces for Islamic art, work with conservation staff on the collection, and research possible acquisitions.
If the fellow is a specialist in the Ancient Americas, she or he will teach at Washington University an introductory level survey in the broad field of Pre-Columbian art as well as upper-level courses in their specialty. At SLAM, the fellow will conduct research on one of the most comprehensive and distinguished collections of Ancient American art in the United States. The collection is comprised of more than 4,500 artworks, more than half of which are Mesoamerican. Ancient art from North America is represented by selections of Mississippian and Southwest works, and there are singular strengths from the Andes and the Caribbean. Outcomes for a Fellow in this area will be determined in concert with the particular interests, expertise, and skill set of the successful candidate.
The applicant should have no more than three years of postdoctoral teaching or curatorial experience in the field at the start of the appointment.

Wow, campus visit already? That was fast. Did they even do preliminary interviews? If they did, they must have been reviewing applications for a while. Or maye they're only interviewing locals? I hate when search committees don't list a deadline. It makes me wonder if my application was even considered.
I sent in my application in early November and just got the email about the campus interview--no preliminary interview. I am not local. Try not to take it personally--this is my third year on the job market and I've learned a lot by trial and error.
Also got an e-mail in mid-January for a campus visit interview - no preliminary interview (I'm not sure why?)...

NOTES:

This is a position at a Baptist University which clearly states that religion can be used a criteria in their search. Note that LBGTQIA applicants are not included in their list of anti-discrimination laws .
I was told during my interview, which lasted about five minutes, that they will only hire a practicing Christian.(12/3)
I was told the same - word of warning to the finalists yet to interviewed that you will be disqualified immediately if you are not a practicing Christian. Disingenuous of the search to not state this upfront, and a waste of their and applicants' time. The right to ""lawfully consider religious practice as a criterion"" is not the same as outright discrimination based on religion, which disqualifying candidates based on religious practice, in fact, is. (12/3)
OP here. I think they are legally allowed to do this and have been doing so since at least 2014. I know two other people who have had the exact same experience as you and me.

Which one of Yale's 2 African art historians will this hire replace?
I would hazard neither. This appears to be a ""new"" post. As RFThompson was very slowly in the process of retiring, Erica James and Kobens Mercer came on board. Neither of them really do ""traditional"" African art of the Colonial period pre 1950. Also, to note, Fred Lamp retired from the Yale Museum in the past two years. Yale has a collection of ""traditional"" African art in its museum as well as donors to the University who are serious collectors of that period of artwork. The University and that department had better get on it if they are going to keep those donors involved... They aren't dumb. I hope.
This is a replacement for Thompson, who retired a couple of years ago.

writing samples requested (8 Jan. 2018) | I logged into Interfolio and it was suddenly requesting 4 writing samples for the Emory application but with no email notification about this. I emailed the SC to double check and was told my application was actually complete and there had been a mistake on their end with Interfolio. I don't know if they intended only certain people to upload samples or no-one.
In response to the previous comment, the writing samples were requested by email and we were given the option to either send them by email to the SC or upload them on Interfolio. Maybe that is why the application forms were reopened?

The Department of Architecture in the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning at Cornell University invites applications for a full-time, tenure-track faculty position in the global history of architecture and urban development (HAUD) beginning in fall 2018.
Architecture at Cornell dates back to the founding of the institution; it is one of the oldest programs of its kind and has a long and distinguished tradition of design, scholarship, and teaching.  Degree programs in the department include a professional bachelor of architecture (B.Arch.); a professional master of architecture (M.Arch.); a post-professional master of science (M.S.) in advanced architectural design; M.S. degrees in computer graphics and matter design computation; and a Ph.D. in the history of architecture and urban development.  The new M.S. degree in matter design computation and state-of-the-art facilities -- including the recently opened Milstein Hall designed by OMA and the soon to be completed Mui Ho Fine Art Library -- reflect both a continuing commitment to excellence and an ongoing renewal of architectural education at Cornell.
We seek an innovative scholar and teacher who demonstrates commitment to critical historiographical and theoretical perspectives, and whose research interests complement but do not duplicate current faculty strengths.  The successful candidate will participate in and contribute critically and pedagogically to an architectural curriculum that offers B.Arch., M.Arch., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees.

Concordia Universityƒ??s Department of Art History and the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema in the Faculty of Fine Arts invite applications for a full-time, cross-appointed tenure-track faculty position in Canadian Moving Image Arts Studies to begin August 1, 2018. 
Context:
With over 4,000 students, faculty, and staff, the Faculty of Fine Arts is among the five largest art and design schools in North America. Montre?al, our home, is exceptional: with 170,000 university students, a vibrant cultural scene, and the most affordable tuition in Canada, the city ranks among the top ten best destinations in the world for tertiary education. While supporting a significant Anglophone population, Montre?al is the second largest French-speaking city after Paris. North Americaƒ??s number one choice for international events and festivals, Montre?al was the first metropolis to be designated a UNESCO City of Design by the Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity. Nestled in the heart of this pulsing city, embraced by a dynamic research university, the Faculty of Fine Arts benefits from extraordinary access to brilliant practitioners, thriving venues, cross-cultural perspectives, and an extensive network of outstanding facilities for research and production.
Faculty and Departments:
Taking advantage of our place within the rich fabric of a research university and our long history as one of the premiere sites in Canada for the study and creation of the arts and arts-based scholarship, the Faculty of Fine Arts is currently engaged in a transformative moment in which pedagogical, conceptual, theoretical, and material practices find resonance with a significant diversity of approaches. In our university community, live performance, historical research, methodological innovation, theoretical scholarship, technical experimentation, skills-based production, community fieldwork, as well as traditional and digital fabrication are equally valued. In addition to curricular experimentation, the formation of significant research centres and external partnerships in the Faculty of Fine Arts have enriched opportunities for faculty and students. In 2018 a new Media Bank will open in the Faculty, in which the combined film, video, and image archives of Art History and Film Studies will be housed. This facility will include seminar rooms, breakout space, as well as viewing stations available to students and faculty, and offers great potential for future research initiatives and activities.
The Department of Art History is a vital environment for the study and research of artƒ??s histories, theoretical frameworks, visual and material culture, curatorial practice, education and community engagement. As one of Canadaƒ??s leading programs, the Department of Art History offers full undergraduate degree programs in Art History, Art History and Film Studies, and Art History and Studio Art, as well as an MA in Art History and an interuniversity PhD, offered collaboratively with three other institutions. Our curriculum and research reflect a diversity of approaches, and we encourage students to become active contributors to the discipline throughout their studies. The Department of Art History is a mutually supportive environment with a longstanding tradition of ground-breaking scholarship and where teaching is active and innovative, with public learning outcomes often providing a means to invite a sense of shared purpose among our student body and larger university community.
The Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinemaƒ??Canadaƒ??s largest university-based centre for the study of film animation, film production and film studiesƒ??is highly regarded around the world. The School has the distinct advantage of being situated in Concordiaƒ??s vibrant Faculty of Fine Arts, where faculty and students enjoy numerous cross-disciplinary opportunities, state-of-the-art resources and facilities, and a rich artistic and cultural context for research and study. Currently, the Schoolƒ??s faculty complement includes 26 full-time professors and a talented cadre of part-time instructors, teaching more than 800 students. The School hosts programs in Film Production, Film Animation, and Film Studies. Among the degrees offered are a BFA in Film Studies, a BFA in Art History and Film Studies, an MA in Film Studies, and a PhD in Film and Moving Image Studies. Our 12 full-time Film Studies faculty members are active scholars in a diversity of subfields, and our PhD program attracts high-caliber international students, and is among the top Film Studies graduate programs in the world.
Since its creation in 2002, the Major in Art History and Film Studies has offered a course of study at the intersection between art history and film studies as scholarly disciplines. A research and writing-intensive program, it attracts top students and is a growth area for both departments. It is a program in which students develop an interdisciplinary understanding of the visual and audio-visual arts, as well as the critical and theoretical discourses pertaining to each discipline. Since its inception, intersections between experimental film practices and moving image gallery works have increased in current moving image arts practice, as have the challenges and strategies of curating, archiving, and preservation. More than ever, this hybrid program is well situated to train students in an expanded history of the moving image, and the associated institutions, artists, and archival practices.
Position Description:
We are seeking candidates with expertise in moving image arts and visual culture. Moving Image Arts is an umbrella term that includes experimental film, video, installation arts, and expanded cinema, along with other modes of digital artsƒ??all of which have distinct and interrelated histories and futures. We welcome candidates whose research encompasses curating, archiving and historiography. Preference will be given to applicants with a scholarly record focused on any modality of moving image arts and visual culture, including a demonstrated expertise in Canadian, Quebec, and/or Indigenous Media with a research program grounded in one or more of these areas.
Responsibilities:
The successful cross-appointed candidateƒ??s primary department will depend on their field of expertise, but since they will be expected to teach core undergraduate courses in Art History and Film Studies, they must be comfortable within both disciplinary milieux. Responsibilities will also include the stewardship of the BFA in Art History and Film Studies, including review of curriculum, timetable co-ordination, and mentoring students. In this role, they should demonstrate the ways collaborative, interdisciplinary research and pedagogy in Art History and Film Studies are central to the continued success of this program. The candidate should be prepared to supervise graduate students in either Art History or Film Studies, or both, and serve on graduate supervisory committees, as well as actively embrace program and department stewardship, perform administrative duties and engage in committee work at the department and Faculty levels. Prior activities demonstrating leadership, service, and commitment to diversity will be an asset.
Qualifications:
Applicants should hold a PhD in either Art History or Film Studies, or a related discipline(s), have substantial teaching experience at the university level, and must demonstrate an active program of research as well as a record of publications. They should have a significant research and scholarly profile in Canadian, Quebec, and/or Indigenous moving image arts studies. Additional expertise in curatorial and archival activities will be considered an asset for the position. Although classes are taught in English, a foundation in French would be considered a strong asset.
Application Requirements and Deadline
Applications should be submitted electronically to arth.film@concordia.ca on or before November 1, 2017.

NOTES:

This search was conducted last year, 2016-2017 . Here are the notes from 2016-2017:
This is a position at a Baptist University which clearly states that religion can be used a criteria in their search. Note that LBGTQIA applicants are not included in their list of anti-discrimination laws .
I was told during my interview, which lasted about five minutes, that they will only hire a practicing Christian.(12/3)
I was told the same - word of warning to the finalists yet to interviewed that you will be disqualified immediately if you are not a practicing Christian. Disingenuous of the search to not state this upfront, and a waste of their and applicants' time. The right to ""lawfully consider religious practice as a criterion"" is not the same as outright discrimination based on religion, which disqualifying candidates based on religious practice, in fact, is. (12/3)
OP here. I think they are legally allowed to do this and have been doing so since at least 2014. I know two other people who have had the exact same experience as you and me.

NOTES:

They hired someone for this poistion 18 months ago and she is still listed on their website; any idea what's going on there? Are they adding another early modern line?
That person is still there so it must be a new line ***""with a transregional, transcultural, or global focus""***
So transcultural, but not overlapping with Daniela Bleichmar? 
I spoke to them and was told they used to have 3 or 4 early modernists and are actively rebuilding the field. I was told that the transregional is an interest but not a requirement.

The School of Art and Design within the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University is seeking applicants for a one-year, full-time Visiting Assistant Professor position in Art History to teach African-American Art History.
This full-time one-year sabbatical replacement position consists of a 2/2 teaching load plus faculty service.
In addition to African-American Art History, the ideal candidate will also be able to teach an introductory course in the visual culture of Africa and/or its American diasporas (South, Central, the Caribbean, or Mexico) from the early modern period (c. 1500) to the present, to help satisfy our non-Western curricular offerings.

For the service component, we especially seek candidates who would be involved with diversity-related initiatives at AU, in particular the Art Force 5 (AF5), an award-winning applied learning program that offers students the opportunity to use art for social justice. Most recently, the AF5 has been invited to partner with NYS Office of General Services as they prepare their Harlem Art Collection to be returned to public view. The AF5 will serve to educate various communities on the relevance of this collection and organize community events. The hired candidate may assist in optimizing opportunities and preparing Alfred University students for such collaboration. The project is funded by a SUNY grant, which enables students to travel the state while engaging in social practice involving issues of equality, community, and history.

Located in Western NY, Alfred University is the second oldest co-educational college in the United States and one of the earliest to have enrolled African-American and Native American students. Ideal candidates will demonstrate an appreciation of issues that matter to our university community, such as diversity and social justice.
Though open to all undergraduate students at Alfred University, Art History courses primarily serve degree candidates in studio art (BFA), art history and theory (BS), and graduate students (MFA). The Art History curriculum is an integral part of the program at the School of Art and Design. The Division of Art History is one of six divisions in a comprehensive program with a very active faculty and prolific student body who access renowned facilities for artistic and scholarly research.

Earlham College is a small liberal arts college with an enrollment of about 1100 students.  Recognized nationally for the quality of its academic programs, the college attracts a student body that is national and international in composition.  The Art Department at Earlham College is unusual among liberal arts schools, because it emphasizes both craft and art.

Each art major at Earlham chooses art history, ceramics, drawing, metalsmithing, painting, photography or fiber arts as an area of focus.  In addition to building competency in a focus, each student also takes Making Art, and art history courses.  Seniors complete a senior project, which generally leads to a group exhibition held in Leeds Gallery or the presentation of a research paper. Each art major completes an internship as well.   We encourage art students to participate in one of Earlhamƒ??s many off-campus programs.  Over 60% of our students spend a semester or more off campus in a great variety of places such as as London, Japan and New Zealand.

The college also offers a semester of intense studio practice at Penland School of Craft.  PhD preferred.  An interest in teaching undergraduates in a liberal arts context is essential.

Offer Accepted: I was a finalist. Received email notice on 4/12 that they have filled the position with a different candidate. They never contacted my references. (x3 - I was also a finalist and received the same email today. They never contacted my references, either.)
If my information is correct, they brought to campus three finalists from out of town. Three finalists have reported they did not get the job. That means there was a fourth candidate. My guess is that it was their current visiting professor and it was she who got the job. I'm just speculating--I could be wrong about that; maybe it was a different local person. But what I do know is that when the search committee took me out to dinner the evening before my interview they just talked to each other and didn't ask me a single question. It was weird and uncomfortable and a huge red flag that they already knew they weren't seriously interested in me before I even arrived.
4/12: Rejected by then via email A SECOND TIME!!!

NOTES: 

This search was conducted last year, 2017-18, and two years ago,2016-2017 . Here are the notes from 2016-2017:
This is a position at a Baptist University which clearly states that religion can be used a criteria in their search. Note that LBGTQIA applicants are not included in their list of anti-discrimination laws .
I was told during my interview, which lasted about five minutes, that they will only hire a practicing Christian.(12/3)
I was told the same - word of warning to the finalists yet to interviewed that you will be disqualified immediately if you are not a practicing Christian. Disingenuous of the search to not state this upfront, and a waste of their and applicants' time. The right to ""lawfully consider religious practice as a criterion"" is not the same as outright discrimination based on religion, which disqualifying candidates based on religious practice, in fact, is. (12/3)
OP here. I think they are legally allowed to do this and have been doing so since at least 2014. I know two other people who have had the exact same experience as you and me. 
I think this is not unfortunately illegal and I also know people who have had this experience with Christian universities. Sad reality but pretty sure there is no way to fight this.

The Department of Art History in the College of Liberal Arts invites applications for two full-time, open rank faculty positions in Global Art History beginning in August 2019. Both positions begin fall semester 2019 (08/26/2019). Appointments will be 100% time over the nine-month academic year (late-August to late-May). Appointments will be at the rank of tenure-track assistant professor, tenured associate professor, or tenured professor, depending on qualifications and experience, and consistent with collegiate and University policy. Both positions are open rank, but only one appointment may be made at the level of tenured associate professor or tenured full professor.
The Department of Art History seeks two new faculty members to join a dynamic department with a strong commitment to global art history and to critical and theoretical engagement with art-historical methods and practice. As a public, land-grant university, we seek candidates who will challenge undergraduate and graduate students to develop skills of art-historical literacy; who are committed to excellence and creativity in writing; and who will promote student engagement through initiatives such as our undergraduate minor in museum and curatorial studies. Our new hires will develop curricula that complement existing geographical and historical coverage in the department, work collaboratively with their colleagues in art history as well as faculty in other departments and programs, and participate in the interdisciplinary life of the College.
One of the two hires will be a scholar of pre-1800 art from any region of interconnected Asia broadly definedƒ??including the Mediterranean region, East Africa, the Middle East, Indian Ocean, and East and Southeast Asia. The area of expertise is therefore open, and should complement areas already represented by faculty in the department.

The Department of Art History in the College of Liberal Arts invites applications for two full-time, open rank faculty positions in Global Art History beginning in August 2019. Both positions begin fall semester 2019 (08/26/2019).
Appointments will be 100% time over the nine-month academic year (late-August to late-May). Appointments will be at the rank of tenure-track assistant professor, tenured associate professor, or tenured professor, depending on qualifications and experience, and consistent with collegiate and University policy. Both positions are open rank, but only one appointment may be made at the level of tenured associate professor or tenured full professor.
The Department of Art History seeks two new faculty members to join a dynamic department with a strong commitment to global art history and to critical and theoretical engagement with art-historical methods and practice. As a public, land-grant university, we seek candidates who will challenge undergraduate and graduate students to develop skills of art-historical literacy; who are committed to excellence and creativity in writing; and who will promote student engagement through initiatives such as our undergraduate minor in museum and curatorial studies. Our new hires will develop curricula that complement existing geographical and historical coverage in the department, work collaboratively with their colleagues in art history as well as faculty in other departments and programs, and participate in the interdisciplinary life of the College.
One of the two hires will be a scholar whose research centers on the long and enduring nineteenth century. The ideal candidate will have a track record of work that views art and its history in light of the eraƒ??s slow-moving and still-ongoing transformations: including industrialization, imperialism, corporatization, and enslavement -- as well as the rise of modern museology and art history. This work may focus on any geographic or cultural area; our preference is for scholarship that adopts a global and/or translocal perspective. We are especially keen to identify inventive scholars whose teaching and publications rupture traditional art historical categories and specializations, so as to bring forward artistic practices and objects that have otherwise been long overlooked. Our new colleagueƒ??s efforts will be matched and supported by ongoing movements underway at Minnesota (both in the department and campus wide): including the Masters in Heritage Studies and Public History, the RIGS Initiative (Race, Indigeneity, Gender, and Sexuality Studies), and the Humanities Engagement Hub.
Responsibilities include: engaging actively in research; teaching courses on all undergraduate and graduate levels; the supervision of senior projects, M.A. qualifying papers, and doctoral dissertations; and contributions to service appropriate for the rank of appointment to the department, college, University, and profession.The Standards for Promotion and Tenure in the Department of Art History are available at:https://faculty.umn.edu/sites/faculty.umn.edu/files/art_history.pdfThe Workload Principles and Guidelines for Regular Faculty in the College of Liberal Arts are available at: https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/cla-intranet/ofaa/resources/workload-principles--guidelinesFaculty in the College of Liberal Arts are expected to maintain an active program of scholarly research; develop and teach undergraduate and graduate courses; advise students; and contribute service appropriate for the rank of appointment to the department, college, university, and profession.

Probationary appointment leading to a tenure decision. 1.0 FTE. Service and committee work expected. The successful candidate will be expected to develop collaborative working relationships with Native American academic units and groups on campus, and with Indigenous communities off campus locally and in the surrounding region.
The Art History program at UNM is unique in the nation, if not the world, for its concentration in Arts of the Americas. To date, this is the only program with full-time faculty in Pre-Hispanic Art, Spanish Colonial Art, Modern/Contemporary Latin American Art, Native American Art, U.S. and African American Art, and until recently, U.S. Latinx/Chicanx Art. Given the Indigenous presence across the Americas, Native American art overlaps with and is relevant to all of these other areas of specialization. Additionally, areas of study outside of Art History, both in the Department of Art and the College of Fine Arts, intersect with Native American art history, such as Land Arts of the American West, Pueblo Pottery, Studio Ceramics, Art and Ecology, and Ethnomusicology.
The longstanding presence of Native Pueblos and their cultural impact in the region make this area an ideal location for the study of Native history, culture, and art, both historical and living. Also, the presence of museums and community centers, such as the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center in Albuquerque and the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, and including other nearby centers, such as Sky City Cultural Center and Haakƒ??u Museum at Acoma Pueblo, among others, are invaluable resources not found anywhere else.
Qualifications
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:

The Department of Art History and Archaeology at Washington University in St. Louis is pleased to invite applications for the inaugural Mark S. Weil Endowed Chair in Early Modern European Art, 1400-1750. This appointment, to be made at the rank of Advanced Associate Professor or Full Professor, will begin in fall 2019 or later. We seek a candidate with wide interests in the histories, theories, and methodologies of art history. We invite concentration in any area that complements the current strengths of our faculty which lie in the field of Italian Renaissance art and architecture. Possible fields of specialization include (but are not limited to) Dutch, Flemish, Spanish, German, French, and British art, and Italian Baroque. There is no limit to what a secondary field of interest might be. Applications are especially encouraged from candidates who work broadly within the time frame of 1400 to 1750, and/or across national and geographic borders to address large questions of cultural formation, artistic identity and practice, European and/or global networks of exchange, and the social, religious, political and philosophical significance of the visual arts in the early modern period in Europe.
This Department, one of the oldest masters and doctoral programs in art history in the Midwest, has a distinguished tradition of teaching in this area. Our small but excellent program benefits from strong institutional support and substantial resources, and we serve some hundred undergraduate majors and minors, and about twenty-five MA and PhD students. Faculty in this area profit from intellectual collaborations with our Departments of Romance Languages and Literatures, English, History, German, and Classics; a newly established graduate certificate in Early Modern Studies facilitates interdisciplinary exchange for faculty and graduate students alike. We also have access to outstanding museum resources in this field, and collaborate actively with curatorial colleagues both at the Saint Louis Art Museum, and the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum and the Special Collections division in the newly expanded Olin Library on campus.
Duties include teaching two courses a semester in areas of specialization at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Teaching in large gateway courses is a possibility, according to interest and experience. Other responsibilities include conducting research, writing for scholarly publication, advising students at all levels, participating actively in department governance, and in university service. A PhD in the History of Art and/or Visual Culture, or a closely related field, is required.
Applications received by November 2, 2018 will receive full consideration. Consideration after that date will be at the discretion of the search committee. Applicants should submit a letter of application that includes a statement of research and teaching interests, a curriculum vitae, one writing sample and other relevant materials. All items should be emailed to the Weil Chair Search Committee at artsci-weilchair@email.wustl.edu. Applicants should request one letter of reference at the time of application. It should be emailed to the Weil Chair Search Committee at artsci-weilchair@email.wustl.edu or sent in hard copy to the Department of Art History and Archaeology, Campus Box 1189, Washington University in St. Louis, One Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO 63130.

While the candidateƒ??s scholarly agendas are expected to center on historical topics from the nineteenth century onwards, the teaching package may include survey courses ranging from 1500 to the present.
Candidates must have a Ph.D. degree in the discipline or its equivalent. A strong record of publication and engaged participation in scholarly discourses on design is expected. A professional degree in a design-related field is also desirable. Candidates must demonstrate superior communication and collaboration skills.

The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) has embarked on a focused cluster hiring plan to recruit top-tier researchers in interdisciplinary areas of knowledge that will advance the study of Social and Environmental Challenges in Latin America.  Home to some of the largest bioreserves in the world and some of worldƒ??s most important biodiversity hotspots, Latin Americaƒ??s environments are undergoing rapid transformation due to climate change, environmental degradation, and politico-socio-economic transformations across the region.  These forces are coupled in complex ways, and understanding the coupled dynamics of society, climate, and environment in Latin America presents a grand challenge that is fertile ground for transdisciplinary research.
To address this challenge, UTSA is recruiting a cohort of researchers from different disciplines whose research centers on environmental degradation, climate change, and the associated socioeconomic and political challenges and transformations in Latin America and the US-Mexico borderlands. The goal is to foster collaborative and transdisciplinary research to understand and confront the emerging social and environmental challenges facing the region.  This targeted cluster hire will build on and leverage our established research portfolio, propelling our ability to tackle and solve previously unsolvable problems. Hires are expected to build their own unique programs of research, as well as to collaborate with other hires in this cluster and with colleagues in their home department, college, and other colleges.
As part of this cluster, we seek to hire a tenured or tenure-track scholar (Assistant or Associate Professor) in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures and/or the Department of Art and Art History. We seek a scholar who applies eco-criticism approaches to the literature, visual arts, and/or the media to address topics such as colonialism and human rights in colonial or contemporary Latin America and/or the Caribbean. The ideal candidate will also create transdisciplinary collaborative synergies among faculty hired as part of this cluster and existing faculty in the Departments of Art and Art History, Modern Languages and Literatures, English, and History, among others.  We would particularly welcome a scholar who complements current faculty in terms of theoretical perspectives, methods, media of study, and time and region of focus.
Required Qualifications: Ph.D. in Art History, Spanish, Latin American Studies, or related field in hand at time of application; theoretically motivated research; an established record of teaching, research, and service appropriate to rank; demonstrated interest and experience in collaborative teaming and/or transdisciplinary research; desire and ability to contribute to graduate and undergraduate programs and to educate and mentor students from a culturally diverse urban population.
For consideration as Associate Professor, candidates must have a strong record of publication, evidence of effective teaching, and substantial experience in department, university, and professional service.  Tenure is contingent on Board of Regents approval.
Preferred Qualifications: Native or near-native fluency in Spanish and/or Portuguese; potential for securing external funding; experience in cross-disciplinary areas of inquiry that intersect art history, literature studies, media studies, cultural studies, linguistics, translation studies, and/or film studies. Preferred candidates will be able to successfully teach and mentor diverse, underserved students, including first-generation students, students of color and non-traditional students, and have the ability to contribute to the universityƒ??s commitment to inclusive excellence as a Hispanic Serving Institution.
Responsibilities include: teaching introductory, upper division, and graduate courses; research and service in a program that offers B.A. and M.A. degrees; maintaining an active research agenda; leadership in developing new lines of research and teaching; contributing to the university and community through service and outreach.
Applicants must submit:
a letter of application describing research, teaching, and service accomplishments and goals that includes a discussion of the role that diversity and inclusion play in an academic environment; please indicate the rank for which you wish to be considered 

a CV
up to three representative publications, which could include dissertation chapters
teaching evaluations if available
names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of three references. 
Materials must be submitted on-line https://jobs.utsa.edu/postings/14346.  Please reference posting TT20190062P. Review of applications begins November 1, 2019.  For full consideration, applicants should submit their materials by that date.  Inquiries may be directed to the Cluster Search Committee Chair, Dr. Jason Yaeger (jason.yaeger@utsa.edu).

Earlham College invites applications for a full-time tenure track position in the Art Department at the rank of Assistant Professor, beginning August 2020. Responsibilities include teaching six art history courses per year: a two-semester global survey and four additional mid-level and upper-level offerings. The curriculum in art history serves the needs of majors in studio art and art history, as well as the general education curriculum of the college. Responsibilities include close work with students and working cooperatively with members of the Art, Music, and Theatre Arts faculties in furthering the cause of the arts in the College.
PhD (or ABD) in Art History or a closely-related field is strongly preferred. A concentration in Modern/Contemporary Art or the History of Craft is preferred. We seek applicants who adopt a global approach in their teaching and research and who are conversant with visual studies, material culture, and critical race theory. We would particularly welcome scholars eager to contribute to the collegeƒ??s many transdisciplinary programs, such as: Womenƒ??s, Gender, Sexuality Studies; African and African American Studies; Peace and Global Studies; Japan Studies; or Museum Studies. College-level teaching experience, and a demonstrated ability to teach and mentor students from diverse educational and cultural backgrounds, would be especially desirable. An interest in teaching undergraduates in a liberal arts context is essential. We especially welcome applicants who are sympathetic to Quaker values, including a commitment to social justice, educational equity, and respect for all persons. Candidates who bring experience that will contribute to the diversity of the college are strongly encouraged to apply.
Earlham College is a small liberal arts college in Richmond, Indiana, with about 1000 students. Recognized nationally for the quality of its academic programs, the college attracts a student body that is national and international in composition. The Art Department at Earlham College is unique among liberal arts schools, due to its emphasis on experiential learning within both the craft and fine art traditions. This program depends upon the Art History position to provide a foundational background for both. Along with Art majors, many students who are non-majors take studio art and art history courses at all levels and often are the majority of students in the class.
Each Art major chooses art history, ceramics, drawing, metalsmithing & 3D fabrication, painting, photography, or fibers as an area of focus. In addition to building competency in a focus, all Art majors take a variety of studio and art history courses and complete an internship. Their senior capstone project generally leads to a group exhibition or the presentation of a research paper.
Art students take advantage of Earlhamƒ??s many off-campus programs. Over 60% of our students spend a semester or more in a variety of places such as London, Japan, and New Zealand. Each year, several students spend a semester in an internship or apprenticeship in New York City, under the auspices of the NY Arts Program (operated by Ohio Wesleyan and the GLCA). Earlham also offers a semester of intense studio practice at Penland School of Craft.
Applicants should submit a letter of application, curriculum vitae, three letters of recommendation, a teaching statement, and a 300-500 word statement describing your ability to contribute to the advancement of Earlhamƒ??s goals of being a diverse and inclusive institution.

Job Summary
The Art Department at Oberlin College invites applications for a full-time, tenure track faculty position in the College of Arts and Sciences. Initial appointment to this position will be for a term of four years, beginning fall 2020, and will carry the rank of Assistant Professor.




About
Founded in 1833, Oberlin is a private four-year, selective liberal arts college near Cleveland, Ohio and is also home to an outstanding Conservatory of Music. Together, the two divisions enroll approximately 2900 students. Oberlin College was the first college in the US to make interracial education and co-education central to its mission. The College continues to view a diverse, equitable and inclusive educational environment as essential to the excellence of its academic program.
The successful hire in Modern and Contemporary Art History will be joining a department committed to diversity in the design of our curriculum and in the teaching of our various subfields. Our curriculum is dedicated to analyzing how art and the spatial environment shape social, political and historical structures of race, class, sexuality, and gender. Over the last five years, the department has made a successful transition from a curriculum focused predominantly on Western European art to one with more global coverage, both through new hires in the subfields of African/African Diasporic art and Islamic art (complementing the longer-standing coverage of Chinese and Japanese art) and through a more global approach to the remaining fields of European art. We are eager to continue our efforts of diversifying our curriculum and to reach an even more diverse student body through our hire in Modern and Contemporary art history.
For information on the Oberlin Art Department, see: http://new.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/departments/art/ . The Art Department is located next to the Allen Memorial Art Museum (http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/ ), which houses an important collection of modern and contemporary art, and the Oberlin College Art Library (http://www2.oberlin.edu/library/art/index.html ), which has significant holdings of artistsƒ?? books and mail art. Among the many rich collections of modern and contemporary art nearby are the Cleveland Museum of Art, MOCA (the Museum of Contemporary Art, Cleveland), and the Transformer Station in Cleveland, the Akron Art Museum, and the Wexner Center in Columbus.
Responsibilities
We welcome specialists of any subfield or region within the field of Modern and Contemporary Art History whose teaching will explore diverse perspectives, methodologies, and geographies. The incumbent will teach 4.5 courses per year at the introductory, intermediate, and advanced levels. Applicants will be required to teach material prior to the twentieth century. They are expected to take advantage of the Allen Memorial Art Museumƒ??s superlative collection of Modern and Contemporary Art in their teaching and to build interdisciplinary bridges to other programs and departments across campus. The successful candidate will also make important contributions to the Studio Art program. In addition to excellence in teaching, the incumbent will be expected to engage in sustained scholarly, peer-reviewed research, and may engage in other creative work appropriate to the position. The successful candidate will contribute actively to the life of the Department in the full range of faculty responsibilities, including academic advising, as well as service on College committees.
Qualifications
Among the qualifications required for appointment is the Ph.D. degree (in hand or expected by the first semester of the academic year 2020-21) in Art History or a related field. Candidates must demonstrate interest and potential excellence in undergraduate teaching and mentored research. Successful teaching experience at the college level is desirable. Because Oberlin regards inclusion and diversity as hallmarks of excellence, we seek a candidate who will bring a commitment to and/or experience in working with underrepresented and diverse academic populations. We encourage applications from candidates across the globe.
Oberlin College prohibits discrimination and harassment based on the following categories: race, color, sex, marital status, religion, creed, national origin, disability, age, military or veteran status, sexual orientation, family relationship to an employee of Oberlin College, genetic information, and gender identity and expression.

Within the range established for this position, salary will be commensurate with qualifications and experience and includes a competitive benefits package.

The University of Richmond Department of Art & Art History invites applications for a tenure-track position in the History of Modern and Contemporary Art at the assistant professor level beginning in August 2020. Applicants working in any area within this broad field are welcome. The position is not limited by geographical focus. We are particularly interested in interdisciplinary scholars whose research and teaching prioritize diverse perspectives and histories and who demonstrate an understanding of the experience of those under-represented in higher education. Applicants should aim to promote inclusivity and dialogue both within the classroom and the larger communities of the University and the city of Richmond. The University is conducting initiatives in both the Arts and Humanities, developing a long-term vision for the School of Arts & Sciences and implementing a strategic plan that focuses on inclusivity and academic excellence. We are interested in individuals, trained as art historians, who want to engage this crucial moment in the visual arts and who see their work as participating in a public conversation about the role of the arts at the University and in contemporary society. The teaching load is five units per year.
The Department of Art and Art History is home to the Art History and Visual and Media Arts Practice (VMAP) programs and, in collaboration with University Museums, an Arts Management program. The Art History curriculum requires its majors to take a Theory and Methodologies course and write a senior thesis over two semesters. The instruction of these capstone courses is shared by the full faculty of the art history program. Any potential candidate should welcome the opportunity to act as the instructor of record every third or fourth year, guiding the students in substantial independent research. Although this position is in the art history program, the ideal candidate will also engage the VMAP curriculum, faculty and students and demonstrate interdisciplinary interest in other curricular developments at the University, such as the Humanities Initiative. We seek scholars who demonstrate scholarly promise and embody the diversity of the United States, as well as the global society in which we live. We strongly encourage applications from women, racial and ethnic minorities, and other individuals who are under-represented in the profession across color, creed, race, ethnic and national origin, physical ability, gender and sexual identity, or any other legally protected status.
The University of Richmond is a private university located just a short drive from downtown Richmond, Virginia. Through its five schools and wide array of campus programming, the University combines the best qualities of a small liberal arts college and a large university. With nearly 4,000 students, an 8:1 student-faculty ratio, and more than 90% of traditional undergraduate students living on campus, the University is remarkably student-centered, focused on preparing students ƒ??to live lives of purpose, thoughtful inquiry, and responsible leadership in a global and pluralistic society.ƒ?
The University of Richmond is committed to developing a diverse workforce and student body, and to modeling an inclusive campus community which values the expression of difference in ways that promote excellence in teaching, learning, personal development, and institutional success. Our academic community strongly encourages applications that are in keeping with this commitment. For more information on the Department of Art and Art History, please see https://art.richmond.edu/.
Applicants should click ""Apply Now"" at the top of the page and submit the following materials: a curriculum vitae, cover letter, and teaching statement. The teaching statement should articulate the candidateƒ??s teaching philosophy, interests, and future professional development goals as well as involvement in and commitment to inclusive pedagogy.

With the generous support of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Dartmouth is pleased to accept applications for three postdoctoral fellowships in the humanities and humanistic social sciences from Fall 2021 to the end of Spring 2023. These fellowships foster the academic careers of scholars who have recently received their Ph.D. degrees by permitting them to pursue their research while gaining mentored experience as teachers and members of the departments and/or programs in which they are housed. The program also benefits Dartmouth by complementing existing curricula with underrepresented fields.
We seek candidates for placement in one of Dartmouth's Arts and Humanities departments/programs, listed below. This year, we are not accepting applications in History or in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. If your degree is in History but your humanistic interdisciplinary work is appropriate for placement in one of our Arts and Humanities departments/programs, then we welcome your application. Applicants must focus on materials customarily associated with research in the humanities or employ methods common in humanistic research.
Dartmouth's Arts and Humanities Departments/Programs:
Departments: Art, Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, English and Creative Writing, Film and Media Studies, French and Italian, German Studies, Music, Philosophy, Religion, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese, Studio Art, Theater
Interdisciplinary Programs: African and African American Studies; Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages; Comparative Literature; Jewish Studies; Latin American, Latino, and Caribbean Studies; Middles Eastern Studies; Native American Studies; Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
Fellows are expected to be in residency at Dartmouth for the full two years of the fellowship, although occasional travel necessary for research may be approved. Fellows teach one course in their home department(s) or program(s) in the second year of their residency. This course may be offered at any level from introductory to advanced topics that contribute something new to the Dartmouth curriculum, and the selection of the course will be made in consultation with the home department(s) or program(s). Fellows do not teach basic language courses.
The appointed fellows will enjoy full use of such college resources as the library, computing center, the Leslie Center for the Humanities, Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences, the Dickey Center for International Understanding, the Hood Museum of Art, and the Hopkins Center. The 2020-22 fellows received an annual stipend of $57,528 plus benefits, an annual research allowance of $2,000, and a first-year-only computer allowance of $2,500. The terms for the 2021-2023 fellows will be similar.
Fellowship applications and departmental requests to house a fellow will be evaluated by the Leslie Center's Advisory Committee, in consultation with the Associate Deans of the Faculty for the Arts & Humanities, Social Sciences, and Interdisciplinary & International Programs. Strong fellowship applications will be circulated to relevant departments and programs, which will then be invited to apply to house one of the candidates. Departments and programs will be expected to justify requests for a fellow by detailing the benefits expected from, and afforded to, that fellow, and by indicating how the fellow might contribute something new, or currently lacking, to the intellectual life of the college.
Qualifications
Applicants for the 2021-23 fellowships must have completed a Ph.D. no earlier than January 1, 2020. Candidates who do not yet hold a Ph.D., but expect to by June 30, 2021, should supply a letter from their home institution corroborating such a schedule. (See ƒ??application instructions,ƒ? below.) There is no requirement that the fellows be U.S. citizens, but the Mellon Foundation does want to see the fellowships awarded to individuals who seem likely to make their careers in the United States.

The Department of Art & Art History and the Department of Design jointly invite applications for a tenure-track faculty position in Design History, with expertise in modern design and design-related technologies in a global context. The successful candidate will have responsibility for teaching and developing curricula for the art history components of undergraduate design education, especially through the teaching of design-in-context, allowing students to analyze their own art or design work more critically. Although based in the Department of Art and Art History, the qualified candidate would be expected to work closely with the faculty of the Department of Design to implement a series of integrated courses that explore contextual influences from the last 100 years of design. In this model, faculty will explore global and inclusive contextual influences with students through techniques, such as case studies of iconic designs; the analysis of diverse cultural contexts for designed objects; and writing assignments that align with studentsƒ?? studio projects and underpin their creative practice. Such courses should assist students in contextualizing and analyzing their own design work more critically, thus elevating discussions around design and research.
The two departments (Art and Art History, and Design) are both committed to creative research and scholarship at the highest level. Our combined art and design facilities are unmatched in the CSU system, and our many graduates go on to prestigious careers in Silicon Valley and beyond. Although each department operates autonomously, under the larger umbrella of the College of Humanities and the Arts, both departments collaborate in significant areas of curriculum, exhibition, and facilities. The most prominent area of collaboration lies in the area of Design History, in which art historians teach a broad array of service courses to BA and BFA students in all areas of design. Design history faculty also collaborate extensively with the faculty in the Department of Design to develop new curriculum that best can serve the needs of contemporary design education. The successful applicant will be required to teach core required courses in the undergraduate Design programs and, ideally, should have research that is related to issues in contemporary design. The successful applicant will also have teaching, advising and mentoring responsibilities in the BA and MA Programs in Art History and Visual Culture, including teaching appropriate graduate seminars and advising MA theses.
The Department of Art and Art History, the Department of Design, and San Jose? State University value diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. Our excellence in research, teaching, and service can only be fully realized by faculty, students, and staff who share our commitment to these values. SJSU enrolls more than 36,000 students, many of whom are historically underserved, and around 45% are first-generation and 38% are Pell-recipients. SJSU is a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander (AANAPISI) Serving Institution. The universityƒ??s commitment to social justice extends from its vibrant, inclusive campus to an international network of over 275,000 alumni. As such, San Jose? State is committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty so our disciplines, students, and the community can benefit from multiple ethnic and gender perspectives.

2021,Middle Eastern / Islamic Art,Islamic Art,"tt, associate_prof, tt, associate_prof",TRUE,"assistant_prof, associate_prof","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA) - TT Assistant or Associate Professor (without tenure) - Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA) - TT Assistant or Associate Professor (without tenure) - Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture
The Department of Architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is seeking to fill a tenure-track faculty position in the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture (AKPIA) in the Department of Architecture. The position is supported by a generous gift from the Aga Khan as part of the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture (AKPIA) at MIT.

AKPIA is an academic leader in the study of architecture and urbanism in the Islamic world. Over the past four decades, the program has graduated leading scholars and practitioners in the field of Islamic Architecture worldwide. Over this period, AKPIAƒ??s students have come from diverse academic and national backgrounds to pursue either an advanced SMArchS degree focused on architecture in the Islamic world, or a PhD degree within the framework of the History, Theory & Criticism program with a focus on the history, theory, and criticism of Islamic architecture or urbanism. The current search aims to build on this tradition while further expanding the scope and ambition of the Aga Khan program to address pressing issues in the Islamic built environment.

The successful candidate will be involved primarily in the study of architecture and/or urban design in the Islamic world, with an interest in design, urban, social, historical and/or environmental questions. They will aid the faculty of the program, and department, in further extending AKPIAƒ??s ambition to address urgent issues facing cities and landscapes in the Islamic world. These include contemporary issues facing the architecture of Islamic societies in a global context; the climate crisis and its unequally distributed effects; the problems of mass urbanization; settlement and displacement, migration and forced displacement; heritage issues; and the quality and conditions of civic space. An important criterion in the search will be the ability of the candidate to engage and collaborate across the realms of design, planning, and contemporary and historical research necessary to engage such essential global challenges.

Candidates should demonstrate evidence of engagement with, and commitment to their work at the highest academic level. This may include works of research, scholarship, and/or design. The individual should be able to demonstrate an ability to develop and teach both graduate and undergraduate courses and supervise Masters and PhD work in an internationally recognized School of Architecture and Planning.

In keeping with MIT's culture of faculty self-governance and the Department's expectations of its faculty, the candidate is expected to participate in the intellectual life and administrative functioning of the department, and to contribute to the department's research and pedagogical agendas. The individual should enjoy collaborating with colleagues, be an articulate communicator, and be dedicated to help steer and support the rich, diverse culture of the Department. In pursuing research, teaching or practice, the individual should also be an effective representative of the department to the external world, in particular to agencies such as the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Aga Khan Development Network.

Dedicated to a humanistic and technologically sophisticated vision of design, history, and pedagogy, the Department of Architecture is uniquely positioned within the School of Architecture and Planning and within the larger institution of MIT, which strongly supports innovation and entrepreneurial activity, cross-disciplinary work, and diversity. The Department is actively committed to building and sustaining a diverse and culturally inclusive community of faculty, students, and staff, and a learning and research environment that welcomes and supports diverse interests, orientations, and work. The academic structure of the Department is unique in that each of its five disciplinary areas (Architecture + Urbanism; Art, Culture and Technology; Building Technology; Computation; and History, Theory and Criticism) work at equal intensity, across boundaries, and in collaboration to create an environment in which innovative research and scholarship fuse with the pedagogical agendas of the studios and ongoing design inquiry.

The Department engages productively in research and education alliances with the other units in the School (e.g., the Department of Urban Studies and Planning; Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism; Media Lab; Program in Media Arts and Sciences; Program in Art, Culture and Technology, and Center for Real Estate). In this exciting context, the Department is explicitly committed to excellence in both pedagogical and research activities. Believing that the cross current between the two creates a charged atmosphere for study and a critical edge for research, we are seeking candidates with an ability to thrive and lead in the Department.

Qualifications:
?ú         The position is designed for a junior or developing scholar for whom a hire at the Assistant or Associate without Tenure level is appropriate. An ability to advance a teaching and research agenda in an academic environment are essential.
?ú         Candidates should hold a terminal degree in architecture or an allied discipline and show proven excellence in teaching, scholarship, design practice or a combination thereof. A Doctoral degree is preferred but not required.
?ú         Prospective candidates should have demonstrated accomplishments that qualify them for the above responsibilities, especially familiarity with countries and regions with substantial Islamic populations and their social, cultural, environmental, and architectural contexts. An advanced degree in architecture is required, either a professional masterƒ??s degree or doctoral degree, as well as extensive experience in an Islamic context; fluency in at least one language of the Islamic world is strongly preferred. 
Application Instructions
Interested applicants should submit: a statement of interest outlining their vision and qualifications for the position, including major professional, research, pedagogical goals and achievements; a curriculum vitae; three current references with contact information; and a maximum 16 page, letter-sized dossier of professional, research or scholarly work.

Applicants who demonstrate a strong commitment to educating and supporting diverse student populations are strongly encouraged to apply. 
Working at Regis University: As Regis employees, we each have a responsibility to perform our work in alignment with the mission of the University, especially with its Catholic and Jesuit values. All employees are expected to both contribute to and strengthen the university's culture of respect, inclusion and equity for all members of our community.

About Regis University and the Fine & Performing Arts Department: The department invites applications from and is committed to hiring qualified candidates from groups that are underrepresented in the field of Art History and within our faculty body. We welcome candidates who bring diverse cultural, ethnic, and religious perspectives to their teaching and scholarship. Our department operates within Regis College which serves a diverse student population. As of fall 2020, 37.4% of our total student body identified as non-white and within that population 23.5% identify as Hispanic/Latino/a/x. Our fall 2020 Freshman class consisted of 55% of students who identified as non-white and 38.75% students who identified as Hispanic/Latino/a/x. We seek applicants eager to work with our increasingly diverse population.
As a Jesuit Catholic University we are open to hiring candidates of all faith backgrounds. In addition, we encourage applicants who identify as non-religious and find secular avenues to uphold Jesuit values. Though many of our faculty do identify as Catholic, a significant number of our current faculty body identify with other religious faiths, and many faculty identify as non-religious. We are also supportive of our LGBTQ+ faculty members.
Regis College is a small, teaching focused, liberal arts college housed within Regis University. We are located in North Denver just minutes from the Denver Art Museum and The Museum of Contemporary Art downtown. Our undergraduate student population has roughly 1750 students and class sizes range from 15-25 students. The Department of Fine and Performing Arts includes the Visual Art Program and the Music Program, and offers undergraduate Bachelor of Arts majors and minors in Visual Art, Art History, and Music. Our O'Sullivan Art Gallery on campus serves art history and art appreciation classes and presents six exhibitions each year including four during the semesters by regional and national artists, our senior thesis exhibition in April, and our heritage series during the summer. We look forward to exhibition ideas and input from our future colleague in this Art History position. Interdisciplinary collaboration is strongly valued in our department. The majority of students we serve as a department are non-majors taking art and music courses. Therefore applicants must be excited to work with a variety of knowledge sets and ability levels. 
Position Summary: This position will be the sole full time Art Historian within a Fine Arts Department of eight full time faculty members (four in Visual Art and four in Music). As a result, our Art Historian position will have a great deal of autonomy in shaping the Art History program. The search is open to all specializations within Art History, but we would particularly welcome a candidate with a dual background in Western and Non-Western Art History (desirable areas of specialization/research include, but are not limited to Indigenous, African, Latin-American, Non-Western art history), who would feel comfortable teaching Non-Western upper division courses. This position will suit an art historian who identifies as a generalist and is excited to teach a wide variety of classes. We also encourage candidates who could offer upper division Art History courses on interdisciplinary topics such as inequality, race and ethnicity, and/or gender and sexuality. 
Position Responsibilities: This position will involve teaching a full load of undergraduate courses each semester. The teaching load is typically 3 fall-semester courses and 3 spring-semester courses. Summer courses are available but not required. Service related responsibilities include: attending program/department meetings, advising Art History Majors for both coursework and thesis writing, conducting scholarly research, and providing service to the university. While Regis values research (and a record of sustained scholarship is required for tenure), a commitment to inclusive teaching is essential; the candidate must demonstrate the skills to work effectively with racially, socioeconomically, and religiously diverse student populations. Experience or interest in supporting student scholarship and collaborative research would also be welcome.

The School of Architecture (SoA) at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte invites applications for a tenure-track appointment in Architectural History at the rank of Assistant Professor. The school seeks candidates eager to expand the depth and breadth of architectural discourse, and to integrate historical and theoretical practices into design education.

Charlotte is a rapidly growing and evolving city, and it offers emerging scholars a vibrant context in which to expand the field.

The Department of Art & Art History at the University of North Carolina Wilmington is seeking a nine-month tenure track (tenure stream) Assistant Professor in Art History beginning August 2022. This position carries a teaching load of three courses per semester. The ideal candidate will have the ability to teach the departmentƒ??s Renaissance through Modern Western survey, our Modern through Contemporary curriculum, and additional upper-level courses fitted to the applicantƒ??s research interests. The department is committed to the idea that we all benefit from a broad diversity of perspectives and experiences and believe that our faculty, our students and our curriculum are essential elements in that vision. We are seeking a colleague who shares that commitment, has potential for excellence in teaching and research and who is interested in being an integral part the department. 
Minimum Education and Experience Requirements: PhD in Art History or related field required at time of appointment.
Preferred Education, Knowledge, Skills & Experience: Previous teaching experience at the undergraduate level is preferred. Though the field of expertise is open, candidates whose research addresses Modern and Contemporary art from a global perspective are especially encouraged to apply. 
Primary Function of Organizational Unit: The Department of Art & Art History currently has twelve full-time and five part-time faculty members. We offer B.A. degrees in Art History, Digital Arts and Studio Art and house the CAB Art Gallery that hosts a range of exhibitions from student to nationally recognized artists. Beyond the major, the Art History faculty and curriculum play a central role in both the DA and Studio Art degrees and are indispensable contributors to the departmental mission: 
The Department of Art and Art History cultivates aesthetic decision making through creative problem solving, critical and analytical thinking, and an understanding of the importance of visual arts in the human experience. 
College/School Information: The College of Arts and Sciences is UNCWƒ??s largest academic unit, employing 450 full-time and 150 part-time faculty members and awarding approximately two-thirds of the universityƒ??s academic credits. Ours is a comprehensive arts & sciences college comprising the arts, the humanities, the mathematical and natural sciences, and the social and behavioral sciences. 
The Collegeƒ??s twenty-five units offer a variety of undergraduate majors leading to the Bachelor of Arts, the Bachelor of Fine Arts, the Bachelor of Music, and the Bachelor of Science. The College also offers a full complement of minors, including interdisciplinary minors such as Africana studies, Asian studies, Forensic studies, Latin America studies, Middle East & Islamic studies, Native-American studies, and Womenƒ??s and Gender studies, among others.  
Applied learning is a hallmark of the student experience in the College of Arts and Sciences. Each of the Collegeƒ??s departments requires an applied learning experience as a part of the curriculum for its undergraduate majors. Examples include faculty-directed research, internships, service learning, and capstone courses and projects, all of which challenge students to integrate various strands of knowledge and to apply that knowledge to broader, real-world or real disciplinary situations. Through applied learning, students in the College gain direct hands-on experience with the skills of their major fields as an essential part of their preparation for life and career. 
In addition to its undergraduate major and minor programs, the College is chiefly responsible for the curriculum that comprises the UNCWƒ??s University Studies Program, through which all UNCW undergraduates gain a foundation in the liberal arts and develop the transferable skills essential for life in the twenty-first century. The College strives in its undergraduate programs and in its University Study offerings to nurture creative thinking, intellectual curiosity, diversity and inclusion, and academic integrity in students while providing them with a solid foundation of knowledge in their chosen fields.

The Department of History of Art and Architecture (HAA) in the Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh seeks to appoint an accomplished historian of modern or contemporary African, African American, or African Diasporic art to the Andrew W. Mellon Chair, with a start date of September 1, 2022. The successful candidate will be appointed at the rank of Associate or Full Professor with tenure. This endowed position provides an opportunity for its holder to undertake significant scholarly initiatives at the departmental, university, and extra-institutional level. It carries substantial research funds and a teaching load of three courses per year. Applicants are expected to have an accomplished record of research and teaching. The successful applicant will be asked to develop and teach courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, supervise doctoral students, undertake service, and participate actively in the life of the department and university. We seek a colleague whose teaching, research, mentorship, and leadership will contribute diverse perspectives and experiences to departmental and university initiatives.
The History of Art and Architecture Department is based in the Frick Fine Arts Building on the University of Pittsburgh's Oakland campus.  We recognize that the University of Pittsburgh occupies the ancestral land of the Adena culture, Hopewell culture, and Monongahela peoples, who were later joined by refugees of other tribes (including the Delaware, Shawnee, and Haudenosaunee), driven here from their homelands by colonizers. 17 full-time faculty members work together to serve the needs of our approximately 30 PhD students; post-baccalaureate Hot Metal Bridge diversity fellows; the 200 majors and minors in our programs in Architectural Studies, the History of Art and Architecture, and Museum Studies; and the hundreds of undergraduate students who enroll in our courses to fulfill General Education requirements. Our faculty includes specialists in the art and architecture of the Americas, East and South Asia, the Islamic Near East, and Europe, across centuries. Our interpretative approaches and lines of inquiry find intersections within our Constellations working groups on Agency, Environment, Identity, Mobility & Exchange, Temporalities, and Visual Knowledge. Our interest in the history of exhibitions and museums finds expression in our research, activities related to the Collecting Knowledge Pittsburgh consortium, and our Museum Studies major and minor. The University Art Gallery, Visual Media Workshop, and Fine Arts Library, all of which are housed within the Frick Fine Arts Building, function as situated learning environments for department members. The appointment of a senior scholar of modern or contemporary African, African American, or African Diasporic art will both strengthen and help connect our research and teaching missions at a crucial inflection point within the history of the department, the University, and the discipline.

We are seeking a teacher-scholar who works on the artistic and narrative traditions and cultural and ecological practices of first peoples from North America and/or the Caribbean, or of first peoples from North America and/or the Caribbean in conversation with hemispheric Indigenous peoples. We welcome applicants who have backgrounds in the fields of North American and/or Caribbean Indigenous Art History, Visual/Media Studies, and/or Literature, with a commitment to teaching interdisciplinary courses that span these disciplines. Scholars with any research specializationâ€”including but not limited to climate justice, art and activism, climate violence, queer/two-spirit studies, extractivisms, multi-species studies, and food studiesâ€”are encouraged to apply. We welcome innovative and unconventional approaches to these fields of study and a commitment to collaborative pedagogies. Applicants from communities that historically have been underrepresented in the academy are encouraged to apply. 

This position will be integral to the Sarah Lawrence Interdisciplinary Collaborative on the Environment (SLICE) program that bridges Sarah Lawrence College and Bronx Community College. In 2020, a group of faculty started the Sarah Lawrence Interdisciplinary Collective on the Environment (SLICE) whose mission is in part to help students develop the tools to address climate justice across disciplines. Our Mellon-funded program foregrounds interdisciplinarity, collaboration, permeable classrooms, and community engagement, and seeks to shape decolonized pedagogies that center different ways of knowing in the humanities. The Mellon Fellow will contribute one course each semester to the SLICE teaching program at Sarah Lawrence, and will be expected to participate in the SLICE program by attending faculty development workshops in the digital humanities, developing shared connections with community partner organizations committed to environmental justice, and collaborating on interdisciplinary programming that will take place each spring semester. The Fellow will publicly present a talk related to their teaching or work each spring, and will be mentored by a member of the SLICE faculty. 
We invite interested candidates to submit a cover letter that speaks to their qualifications, philosophy of teaching and commitment to intellectual justice and how they imagine their pedagogy in a collaborative context; a CV; two one-paragraph course descriptions for seminars; a sample syllabus (for a course previously taught or a prospective course); a sample of their work in any format or length; and three letters of recommendation.

This global view doesnâ€™t seek to dilute the specificity of European artâ€”the particular political, economic, religious, gendered, and racial contours that defined its diverse forms and thematics over the centuries. Rather, it seeks to upend the longstanding Eurocentric art historical worldview that has maintained Europe as an exclusive cultural and epistemological domain.

Appointment to this position will be for a term of one year (two semesters), beginning fall 2023, and will carry the rank of Visiting Assistant Professor.
Founded in 1833, Oberlin is a private four-year, selective liberal arts college near Cleveland, Ohio and is also home to an outstanding Conservatory of Music. Together, the two divisions enroll approximately 2900 students. Oberlin College was the first college in the US to make interracial education and co-education central to its mission. The College continues to view a diverse, equitable and inclusive educational environment as essential to the excellence of its academic program. Among liberal arts colleges, Oberlin is a national leader in successfully placing graduates into Ph.D. programs.

A specialist in this area will allow us to continue our efforts to diversify our curriculum and to reach a more diverse student body. We seek a scholar who will help us expand our geographic and methodological coverage, forge connections to other departments and programs, and develop a research portfolio while at Oberlin.
The Art History Department benefits from its close curricular proximity to the Studio Art Department, as well as the presence of the exemplary collection of the Allen Memorial Art Museum. The Allen includes a celebrated collection of early modern European art and a growing collection of Colonial Latin American art, set within the context of a universal survey museum.

The position is effective August 2023. Collegiate Faculty positions at Virginia Tech are nine-month, renewable, non-tenure-track lines with opportunity for promotion that contribute to the tripartite mission of the institution: teaching, research and service, with an emphasis on teaching and service.

Notes: Is this the 3rd year they've run this search? - yes, the admin keeps pulling the line/offer at the last minute (in the summer, well after candidates have accepted an offer and turned down other options)
- buyer beware: the department has lost all of its full-time Art Historians in the last four years and the college administration has indicated that it plans to shutter the Art History program within 5-10 years. The college has dire budget shortfalls and the administration is extremely unwilling to invest in new tenure appointment and frequently denies tenure. The remaining studio faculty are interested in removing Art History as a major and transitioning the department to Art and Visual Culture.
